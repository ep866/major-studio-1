* This is my p5 game. Counts the mouse moves on X and Y coordinates. Visualizes them as a bar chart and awards points if the number of X moves is equal to the number of Y moves. The game restarts when the user reaches the end of the window width. There is essentially no way to win the game and this is by design - I wanted to create the most annoying game. The logic for winning can be that at scoring 100 points the user wins the game. A timer can be added that awards the user additional points for speed and makes it meaningful to play multiple times to improve one's score. This can be done easily with two additional conditionals but then the game won't be annoying anymore.    

Here is the live version of the game:
