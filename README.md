* This is my p5 game. Counts the mouse moves on X and Y coordinates. Visualizes them as a bar chart and awards points if the number of X moves is equal to the number of Y moves. The game restarts when the user reaches the end of the window width. There is essentially no way to win the game and this is by design - I wanted to create the most annoying game. The logic for winning can be that at scoring 100 points the user wins the game. A timer can be added that awards the user additional points for speed and makes it meaningful to play multiple times to improve one's score. This can be done easily with two additional conditionals but then the game won't be annoying anymore.    

Here is the live version of the game:

####PROJECTS:

#### Data Review 
#####1. Selected Data Sources  

* The topic I am interested in is gender dynamics of the city and how that correlates with different variables. Bellow are the three datasets I found interesting and related to the subject and I also started exploring the data in QGIS to confirm if there is variability to draw conclusions. 

* Disaggregated Demographic Manhattan
_(US Census Block level data?)_

	* I am interested in the female vs male population distribution per block in conjunction with age (possibly median age or more granular). As additional layers I can look at distribution by race. I think it would be interesting to look at this in conjunction with income at a latter date.  
Question: Did anyone get what the source of this dataset is? As far as I could tell it is coming from the census block level data but I could not confirm as the source was not cited.

* MapPLUTO
	* This is one of the richest datasets that the city is making available. I am specifically interested in the land use category, number of floors, year built, units residential and not-residential features from PLUTO. This will be interesting to look at in the context of 3D map tiles. 

* US CENSUS block level data NYC
	* I would like to investigate more in depth the tenure versus vacancy status of units (h4,h5) and correlate these with gender, race, and/or size of household. Locals have some intuition of what the market distribution looks like as well as race distribution but definitely not gender distribution. I think it will be valuable to learn from the dataset what this landscape looks like in reality.

#####2. Supplemental Sources

   - Additional data such as ancestry, language spoken at home, foreign birth region, us citizenship status, and education

  - Social media and inequality in NYC case study. This is informative as it uses recent data and has the benefit of “real-time” reporting.

  - Income and race: comparing cities. Good case study for multivariate geospatial visualizations.

#####3. Questions

* Have you found any evidence of correlation between the ethnic or gender makeup of neighborhoods and risk variables such as risk of flooding or pollution? For example, hispanics or black people tend to live in areas that are flood zones? Or female householders tend to live in most polluted areas in NYC?
 
* Have you looked at gender in relation to your research? As an example, the Greenpoint case study in the wicked problems article, could gender play similar role to race, in identifying potential sources and solutions of the problem?

* Is it fair to speculate that New York City’s population density and constantly changing dynamic (many people rent and come and go rather than settle) contributes to the makeup of neighborhoods? In other words, could I fairly assume that inequality can be measured by proxy of rent, owned vs vacant units?
