The three women complained last year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that they were subjected to a hostile work environment while working for Tratoros Construction Inc., a general contractor hired by the New York Housing Authority to renovate the Williamsburg Houses in northern Brooklyn. After investigating their claims, the commission filed a sexual discrimination suit on their behalf in United States District Court in Brooklyn. In its formal complaint, the commission said, ''Offensive and unwelcome comments were made regarding women's menstruation and sexual activity.'' The complaint accuses one of the company's male supervisors of telling his male colleagues to leave the women alone ''because they had cramps'' and ordered the women to ''change their Pampers.'' The supervisor also asked the women if they had recently had sex and publicly accused two of them of having an affair, according to the complaint. The three women say they were forced to clean bathrooms and kitchens and wash windows while the men did demolition and paint jobs. Chris Curis, a spokesman for Tratoros, said the company denied all of the allegations and he could not discuss continuing litigation.
