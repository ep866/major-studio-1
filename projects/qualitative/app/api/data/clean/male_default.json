Like how all family sitcoms -- virtually all sitcoms now -- are about a fat guy with a hot wife. From CBS, the network of ''The King of Queens'' and ''Still Standing'' comes ''Listen Up,'' the new Jason Alexander show, and ''Center of the Universe,'' starring John Goodman's jowls. ABC, home of ''According to Jim,'' (as in Belushi) has a new comedy called ''Rodney,'' with a country comic named Rodney Carrington, who's not exactly fat but definitely stocky. Fox has no new fat-guy offerings, but ''The Bernie Mac Show'' and ''Quintuplets,'' with Andy Richter, are both back. Not to mention Homer Simpson. Speaking of porked-out cartoon dads, the hefty hero of Fox's uncanceled animated series ''Family Guy'' will return to the network next spring.","abstract":"Rick Marin Beta Male column on fall television season sitcoms, virtually all of which are about fat, lazy, beer-and-TV guys with hot wives; photos (M)","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Father Eats Best","kicker":"BETA MALE"},"pub_date":"2004-09-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2801a8eb7c8105d84ac80"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2004\/07\/11\/style\/beta-male-losing-your-virility-tough-it-out-man.html","snippet":"THE comic hero of ''Jake's Thing,'' Kingsley Amis's painfully funny novel about what was still quaintly called ''impotence'' in 1978, is put through all manner of ludicrous and humiliating psychotherapy.

Maybe three people in Youssouf's whole village owned blue jeans. And on this man's feet -- my goodness. On this man's feet was something that Youssouf had never before seen.

Not long ago an all-male company would have been unthinkable in the former Soviet Union, where the party line did not encourage esthetic nonconformity. So the group's productions may astonish Russian dancegoers. Americans will find them less startling. Beginning with the pioneering efforts of Ted Shawn in the 1930's, American choreographers have occasionally created serious new works for all-male casts. Since the 1970's, little troupes have specialized in spoofs of the classics in which men play female as well as male roles. Both types of productions were featured when the St. Petersburg dancers made their New York debut on Friday night at Avery Fisher Hall.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Male Russian Troupe Tries Drama and Comedy","kicker":"DANCE REVIEW"},"pub_date":"1995-09-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd2014d8eb7c8105d76569b"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1988\/11\/03\/world\/coup-is-reported-in-the-maldives.html","snippet":"LEAD: Gunmen captured the presidential palace today in Male, capital of the Maldives, an Indian Ocean island nation, according to reports reaching Sri Lanka....","lead_paragraph":"LEAD: Gunmen captured the presidential palace today in Male, capital of the Maldives, an Indian Ocean island nation, according to reports reaching Sri Lanka.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Coup Is Reported in the Maldives"},"pub_date":"1988-11-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd17be88eb7c8105d674efc"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9C06E7DB103CE33ABC4D51DFB5668383639EDE","snippet":"Some one, after hearing Mr. Paderewski play many times, remarked that whenever he played, wherever he played, however he played, the listener was always conscious that a great man was playing.

All this time, we've been operating under the mistaken assumption that you were choosing to get all belligerent every time our college boyfriend called, or to tune us out as your eyes became glued to the waitress's breasts showcased in a T-shirt two sizes too small. It stood to reason, we thought, that you could simply choose otherwise, provided, of course, that you wanted to. Now, however, thanks to Louann Brizendine, M.D., author of ''The Male Brain'' (Broadway Books), we understand that choosing otherwise isn't an option, because evolution has outfitted you with a brain that is, biologically speaking, not the same model as the one we were issued. (Brizendine's ''Female Brain'' was published in 2006, should you ever get the urge to consult it.) The epic bouts of road rage, the narcolepsy after sex, the fanatical fixation on the Big East standings, the hunger for movies full of gunfire and explosions -- finally, we get it. Brizendine fills us in on the male brain's larger areas devoted to muscular action, aggression and sex, formed before birth and modulated throughout life by an exquisitely calibrated blend of testosterone, M\u00fcllerian inhibiting substance, androstenedione, vasopressin and other hormones that alter perceptions and lay the groundwork for specific behaviors.","abstract":"Holly Brubach Biblio File reviews Louann Brizendine's new book The Male Brain and The Male Factor: The Unwritten Rules, Misperceptions, and Secret Beliefs of Men in the Workplace by Shaunti Feldhahn; photo (M)","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Its a Guy Thing","kicker":"TALK: BIBLIO FILE"},"pub_date":"2010-03-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Men's Fashion Magazine","section_name":"Style; Magazine; Books","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27bdf8eb7c8105d8416a3"},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2017\/02\/20\/world\/middleeast\/ap-ml-libya-women-travel-ban.html","snippet":"Eastern Libyan authorities have issued a ban forbidding women from traveling outside the country without a male guardian, sparking mockery....","lead_paragraph":"Eastern Libyan authorities have issued a ban forbidding women from traveling outside the country without a male guardian, sparking mockery.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","headline":{"main":"Eastern Libya Ban Women From Traveling Without Male Guardian","print_headline":"Eastern Libya Ban Women From Traveling Without Male Guardian"},"pub_date":"2017-02-20T15:12:42+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Middle East","type_of_material":"News","_id":"58ab077095d0e02474637963"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9F03EED6123DE53ABC4B53DFB466838E629EDE","snippet":"IT IS encouraging to note the increasing interest manifested on all sides in dancing for men, as indicated by inquiries, reports and suggestions emanating from entirely unrelated sources which find their way to this department....","lead_paragraph":"IT IS encouraging to note the increasing interest manifested on all sides in dancing for men, as indicated by inquiries, reports and suggestions emanating from entirely unrelated sources which find their way to this department.","abstract":"Interest increases","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"THE DANCE: A MAN'S ART; Increasing Interest Noted in Masculine Circles -- Programs of the Week"},"pub_date":"1935-02-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc1e9d345c1498b0d51f7ec"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9907E1D81430E633A2575AC0A96E9C94669FD7CF","snippet":"Mme. de Valsayre, a well known Parisian lady, has addressed the following petition to the French Chamber of Deputies:...","lead_paragraph":"Mme. de Valsayre, a well known Parisian lady, has addressed the following petition to the French Chamber of Deputies:","abstract":"Chamber of Deputies' Reply","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"A WOMAN'S APPEAL FOR MALE ATTIRE."},"pub_date":"1887-08-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc014d345c1498b0d135330"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9D06E3DD163DE53BBC4052DFB5668383649EDE","snippet":"TRENTON, March 17 -- Gov.
