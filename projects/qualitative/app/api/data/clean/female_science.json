For the most part, however, THE SCIENCE TIMES BOOK OF MAMMALS is concerned with furrier creatures who appear in this collection of reporting from The Times's Tuesday science section: it explores the hearing of manatees (why can't they learn to avoid boats?), the return of the timber wolf, the probable evolution of the pronghorn antelope's amazing speed. Another volume in the series, THE SCIENCE TIMES BOOK OF ARCHAEOLOGY, examines such recent discoveries as the oldest human footprints, the Stone Age outfit of the Tyrolean Iceman and the prehistoric graves in Kazakhstan whose female occupants have characteristics remarkably like those attributed to Amazons by the ancient Greeks. Both volumes are edited by Nicholas Wade, a reporter and former editor of Science Times, and published by the Lyons Press, $25 each.","abstract":"Brief reviews of books The Scied","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Books From The Times"},"pub_date":"1999-09-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Book Review Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd22a3f8eb7c8105d7b51ac"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9A03E1DF133FE53ABC4153DFB767838F629EDE","snippet":"Death...","lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":"Death","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"MISS MARY E.
