A person with ISD will not start, or respond to their partner's desire for, sexual activity. ISD can be primary (in which the person has never felt much sexual desire or interest), or secondary (in which the person used to feel sexual desire, but no longer does). ISD can also relate to the partner (the person with ISD is interested in other people, but not his or her partner), or it can be general ( the person with ISD isn't sexually interested in anyone). In the extreme form of sexual aversion, the person not only lacks sexual desire, but may find sex repulsive. Sometimes, the sexual desire is not inhibited. The two partners have different sexual interest levels, even though both of their interest levels are within the normal range. Someone can claim that his or her partner has ISD, when in fact they have overactive sexual desire and are very demanding sexually.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"headline":{"main":"Inhibited Sexual Desire"},"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"healthtopic","_id":"52446c2b38f0d8198973c40b"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/health.nytimes.com\/health\/guides\/test\/buccal-smear\/overview.html","snippet":"A buccal  (pronounced \"buckle\") smear is the painless removal of a sample of cells from the inside of your mouth (cheek) for study....","lead_paragraph":"A buccal  (pronounced \"buckle\") smear is the painless removal of a sample of cells from the inside of your mouth (cheek) for study.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"headline":{"main":"Buccal Smear"},"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"healthtopic","_id":"5244739f38f0d8198973c540"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/health.nytimes.com\/health\/guides\/disease\/chlamydial-urethritis-male\/overview.html","snippet":"Chlamydia infection in males is an infection of the urethra (the tube that drains urine from the bladder and passes through the penis).
