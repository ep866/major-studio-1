She mentions some phenomena associated with a traditional wedding -- a long white wedding dress, 100 guests, a typical mother of the bride who had been planning the wedding \"since the day I was born\" -- but something seems to be missing. I don't mean words of male domination like love; I mean what at traditional weddings is the object of the bride's love, the bridegroom. Ms. Gelman makes no mention of the bridegroom. For a moment, I thought this was the ideal feminist wedding, but Ms. Gelman uses the word traditional, and traditional weddings require a live, mobile male body to walk next to the bride. So I concluded that there indeed was a bridegroom at her wedding, but one relegated to semi-personhood, about as important to the wedding as the waiters, but less than the caterer. Ms. Gelman is generationally evenhanded. She doesn't mention her father either.

Yet Ellen Willis fails to offer any evidence in support of such a connection, except to intimate that it is suspicious that both movements are opposed to pornography and both have emerged at the same time. A crucial fact that Ellen Willis chooses to ignore is that feminist objections to pornography are the antithesis of those of the Moral Majority. Feminist opposition to pornography is founded on the belief that pornography is a powerful agent of socialization that shapes human sexuality in such a way as to bolster male dominance and female subservience. As long as men are taught that female bodies are objects of conquest and possession, feminists argue, sexual crimes, from harassment to rape, and a cultural devaluation of women will prevail. In striking contrast, fundamentalists are against pornography because they believe that female bodies and female sexuality are evil and corrupting, the true legacy of Eve. Moreover, the Moral Majority can afford to oppose pornography because, unlike other male-dominated movements, it does not need pornography in order to keep women devalued and subservient - it has the Bible and the traditional family for that.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Invidious Comparison"},"pub_date":"1981-08-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Book Review Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books; Opinion","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd1120c8eb7c8105d5c92ec"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/06\/17\/us\/judges-with-daughters-more-often-rule-in-favor-of-womens-rights.html","snippet":"A study found the effect is especially pronounced in men who were appointed by Republican presidents....","lead_paragraph":"A study found the effect is especially pronounced in men who were appointed by Republican presidents.","abstract":"Adam Liptak Sidebar column; study finds that Supreme Court justices and federal judges with daughters are more likely to vote in favor of women's rights than ones with only sons, and the effect is most pronounced among male judges appointed by Republican presidents; voting trends show up in only civil cases in which gender play a role.","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Another Factor Said to Sway Judges to Rule for Women\u2019s Rights: A Daughter","content_kicker":"Sidebar","kicker":"Sidebar","print_headline":"Another Factor Said to Sway Judges to Rule for Women\u2019s Rights: A Daughter"},"pub_date":"2014-06-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"539f009a38f0d87596d26940"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/learning.blogs.nytimes.com\/2014\/05\/29\/do-you-consider-yourself-a-feminist\/","snippet":"What is your reaction to the word \u201cfeminist\u201d?
