surprise to some critics who tend to characterize them as a bunch of godless radicals, but 60 per cent of the country's half-million college and university faculty members consider themselves religious and, when it comes to politics, 44 per cent call themselves conservative.","abstract":"Exhaustive study by Amer Council on Educ reveals that despite intensive efforts to increase numbers of blacks and women on coll faculties, gains have been negligible; proportion of black faculty members increased from 2.2% in '69 to 2.9% in '72, while proportion of women increased from 19.1% to 20%; study dir, Dr A Bayer, says proportions of women and minority profs have decreased at 2- and 4-yr colls and increased at large univs, possibly because large schools, subject to Govt pressure, have 'raided' staffs of smaller schools; study also finds that: 60% of country's half-million coll faculty consider themselves religious and 44% say they are conservative in pol; comparison with '68-69 survey shows that avg faculty member is now more likely to be older and tenured, indicating there has not been heavy infusion of younger people into profession; univ teachers spend far less time teaching and much more time in research and publishing than do teachers in 2-yr colls; proportion of coll teachers over 40 yrs of age increased from 54.4% in '69 to 58.7% in '72; in reversal of trend of past 2 decades, many young people now completing grad school have difficulty finding academic jobs; situation is creating friction between older and younger faculty, with the latter having difficulty obtaining tenure even when they are hired; at 2-yr colls, 72.6% of teachers spend 13 hrs or more per wk in classroom, while in 4-yr colls figure decreases to 27.6% and at univs to 17.2%; 52.8% of univ faculty teach no more than 2 courses per term, as opposed to 28.6% with such light programs at 4-yr colls and 14.2% at 2-yr colls; 58% of women faculty feel they must play role in emotional development of their students, compared to 36.5% of males; few teachers feel it is their role to help students develop religious convictions; 69.8% of all faculty feel respect for their profession has declined over last 20 yrs; 33.6% say minorities should be given preference in faculty hiring at their schools; only 13.5% say that in retrospect, they would have picked different profession; other figures; graph of female and minority representation on coll faculties, '68-73; illus","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Over 40, White And Male; College

Underlying this concern is the historic competition of religion and sports. Both vie for the same leisure time of their adherents. They share time and space and frequently adjust to each other. Several years ago, the N.F.L. abandoned its plan to begin Sunday games at 12:30 P.M. when members of the Christian clergy feared the mass exodus of male worshipers to attend kickoffs.

My own take is that religion has often been part of the problem, but that it also can be part of the solution. I've seen people kill in the name of religion, and I've seen people reject condoms in the name of religion even as a tool for fighting AIDS (which usually means people dying). But I've also seen Catholic nuns showing unbelievable courage and compassion in corners of the world where no other aid workers are around, and mission clinics and church-financed schools too numerous to mention. And in Islamic countries, I've seen mullahs who are hypocritical misogynists but also some imams who are leading a push for education and justice. In short, I don't think there's any glib answer to the question, but there is no question that religions can be a force for justice and equality that they are now not.
