Hair color is caused by a pigment ( melanin ) produced by hair follicles. With aging, the follicle produces less melanin. Graying often begins in the 30s, although this varies widely. Graying usually begins at the temples and extends to the top of the scalp. Hair becomes progressively lighter, eventually turning white. Many people have some gray scalp hair by the time they are in their 40s. Body and facial hair also turn gray, but usually later than scalp hair. The hair in the armpit, chest, and pubic area may gray less or not at all. Graying is genetically determined. Gray hair tends to occur earlier in Caucasians and later in Asian races.
