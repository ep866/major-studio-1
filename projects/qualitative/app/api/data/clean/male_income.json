To support his argument, he poses the question \"Did . . . women in ancient cities [ pay ] men for sex as often as men paid women?\" While I agree with much of what Dr. Konner has written, I would like to add the following point. In male-dominated societies in which women were prohibited from owning land and inheriting wealth and had little access to professions, a woman who chose or was forced to generate an income independently had only one thing to sell: herself. By the same token, a woman did not have the means to buy sexual pleasure. I suggest that the roots of female prostitution have less to do with differences between male and female sexuality and the desire for pleasure than with economic power. JANET R.

But of course! The limo waiting outside explains why some women still wear high heels long after the rest of femalekind has descended to Nikes. Why they carry purses just big enough for a lipstick, handkerchief, a few bills and a credit card. Why they and their male counterparts forgo raingear. They need only walk the several paces from curb to restaurant door; they can leave their bags and briefcases in the back seat; and wherever there's a chauffeur-driven car there's sure to be a doorman with an umbrella.

President Clinton said the report proved that his economic policies were working and that the middle class was finally on the rise. But a deeper look at the census report finds a gloomier perspective -- the middle class is not doing very well and the poor are falling further behind. The backdrop for the report is an economy that has steadily recovered since 1991 and is growing at a healthy 3 percent a year. Unemployment has dropped below 5 percent to its lowest level in a quarter-century. Inflation is low and falling. Welfare rolls fell almost 10 percent last year. The minimum wage is rising. The economic landscape could not be better for middle-class families in general, and low-wage workers in particular.","abstract":"Editorial notes that Census Bureau set White House aglow when it reported that in 1996 median income rose for second consecutive year while black and Hispanic proverty rates fell; disputes Pres Clinton's contention that report proves that his economic policies are working; maintains that deeper look at census report finds that middle class is not doing very well and poor are falling further behind (M)","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"The Tide Is Not Lifting Everyone"},"pub_date":"1997-10-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1e25c8eb7c8105d72b051"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2017\/01\/08\/business\/08reuters-saudi-economy-ridehailing.html","snippet":"Saudi Arabia hopes its plan to bring a further 1.3 million women into the workforce by 2030 will be given a lift from ride-hailing apps Uber and Dubai-based rival Careem....","lead_paragraph":"Saudi Arabia hopes its plan to bring a further 1.3 million women into the workforce by 2030 will be given a lift from ride-hailing apps Uber and Dubai-based rival Careem.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","headline":{"main":"Saudi Embrace of Ride-Hailing Apps Drives Economic, Social Change","print_headline":"Saudi Embrace of Ride-Hailing Apps Drives Economic, Social Change"},"pub_date":"2017-01-08T08:12:29+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Business Day","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"5871f47495d0e039260798a9"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2000\/02\/23\/jobs\/trends-women-s-earnings-what-a-difference-a-degree-makes.html","snippet":"For women, the pay gap between the educational haves and have-nots has widened inexorably over the last two decades.
