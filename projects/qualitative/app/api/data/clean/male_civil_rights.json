This disagreement underlies radically different approaches to important civil rights issues, in particular the Administration's opposition to hiring quotas based on race and sex to overcome job discrimination and mandatory busing to end school segregation. The Administration's positions on these issues reflect its rejection of a principle embodied in many Federal court decisions: that special preferences for blacks and other disadvantaged groups, and special ''race-conscious'' efforts to integrate schools, are necessary in some cases to avoid perpetuating the effects of past discrimination. William Bradford Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, justified the Administration's opposition to such race-conscious civil rights policies in a recent speech by invoking ''the color-blind ideal of equal opportunity for all.''","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"News Analysis","kicker":"'COLOR-BLIND' RIGHTS LAW"},"pub_date":"1982-03-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.; Washington","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"An Analysis","_id":"4fd11d7b8eb7c8105d5db91f"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/29\/us\/after-a-defeat-in-houston-the-fight-for-gay-rights-shifts-to-jacksonville.html","snippet":"A push to create an anti-discrimination ordinance pits a coalition of gays and business forces against energized Christian conservatives....","lead_paragraph":"A push to create an anti-discrimination ordinance pits a coalition of gays and business forces against energized Christian conservatives.","abstract":"Jacksonville, Fla, holds first of three scheduled meetings between citizens and Mayor Lenny Curry to discuss expanded anti-discrimination ordinance that will extend civil rights protections toward gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people; ordinance, which is expected to go before the City Council in early 2016, pits deeply conservative Christians against supporters of equal rights and select business leaders.","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"After a Defeat in Houston, the Fight for Gay Rights Shifts to Jacksonville","print_headline":"After a Defeat in Houston, the Fight for Gay Rights Shifts to Jacksonville"},"pub_date":"2015-11-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"565a3cc038f0d80bc460a10c"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1989\/11\/07\/us\/supreme-court-roundup-justices-to-rule-on-illinois-bias-case.html","snippet":"LEAD: The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether state courts, in addition to Federal courts, can hear lawsuits brought under the principal Federal law that prohibits race and sex discrimination on the job....","lead_paragraph":"LEAD: The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether state courts, in addition to Federal courts, can hear lawsuits brought under the principal Federal law that prohibits race and sex discrimination on the job.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Supreme Court Roundup; Justices to Rule on Illinois Bias Case"},"pub_date":"1989-11-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd18b478eb7c8105d68da03"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2004\/10\/14\/international\/middleeast\/14shelter.html","snippet":"A sampling of the smashed lives in Baghdad's first shelter for battered women shows just how much work its founder has before her....","lead_paragraph":"A sampling of the smashed lives in this city's first shelter for battered women shows just how much work its founder, Yanar Mohamed, has before her.

At the same time, the Court made it more difficult to seek some rights in the Federal courts. It placed new barriers in the path of prisoners seeking to challenge their convictions in Federal court and giving government officials new protection against suits by citizens whose rights they may have violated. Many of the Court's most important rulings this year seemed more the product of fragile and shifting coalitions among the Justices than of any overriding vision of the law or the Constitution. Among the numerous 5-to-4 decisions were those holding that the President of the United States is absolutely immune from civil suit for illegal or unconstitutional acts taken in his term, that illegal alien children are entitled to a free public education, that male students may not be barred from a state-operated school of nursing and that the Constitution limits the discretion of school boards to remove books from library shelves.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"News Analysis","kicker":"SUPREME COURT TERM: DIVISIONS OVER RIGHTS"},"pub_date":"1982-07-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"Front Page; Education; U.S.; Books","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"An Analysis","_id":"4fd125928eb7c8105d5ebaf7"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/05\/16\/opinion\/16rich.html","snippet":"A new same-sex religious right scandal for an old culture war....","lead_paragraph":"A new same-sex religious right scandal for an old culture war.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"A Heaven-Sent Rent Boy","content_kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","print_headline":"A Heaven-Sent Rent Boy"},"pub_date":"2010-05-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"54463ea038f0d832c813fdf3"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9C00EFDF1031E432A25756C2A9649C946890D6CF","snippet":"ONE of the more striking historical parallels in American politics has to do with the similarity of the origins of the feminist movements of the  19th and 20th centuries: the former in the struggle for the abolition of slavery, the latter in the c...","lead_paragraph":"ONE of the more striking historical parallels in American politics has to do with the similarity of the origins of the feminist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries: the former in the struggle for the abolition of slavery, the latter in the civil-rights movement and the New Left.","abstract":"Evans, Sara: Personal Politics.

Civil rights groups have complained that the new committees, which monitor and report on developments in their states, will be more conservative than the old committees and more likely to abandon their role as advocates for racial minorities and women.

Under Federal law, the advisory committees are rechartered every two years, which allows the White House to change the number and composition of their members. According to statistics released this week by commission officials, there are 313 new appointees among the more than 500 members of the new advisory panels. Men head 46 of the panels and women head 4, as against 31 men and 20 women as chairmen of the old panels. Figures for the previous committees include the one for the District of Columbia, whose rechartering is incomplete.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"STATE RIGHTS PANELS ARE BEING HEADED BY MORE WHITE MEN"},"pub_date":"1985-05-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd151648eb7c8105d633376"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1964\/05\/27\/georgia-campus-cheers-kennedy.html","snippet":"Kennedy s on bill, answers students queries, gets ovation, W Ga Coll...","lead_paragraph":"Kennedy s on bill, answers students queries, gets ovation, W Ga Coll","abstract":"Kennedy s on bill, answers students queries, gets ovation, W Ga Coll","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"GEORGIA CAMPUS CHEERS KENNEDY"},"pub_date":"1964-05-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"535ef77b38f0d82813919727"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/04\/21\/us\/21height.html","snippet":"Ms. Height was a national leader in the civil rights and women\u2019s movements for decades, but she was rarely in the news media spotlight....","lead_paragraph":"Ms. Height was a national leader in the civil rights and women\u2019s movements for decades, but she was rarely in the news media spotlight.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"seo":"Dorothy Height, Unsung Heroine of Civil Rights Era, Is Dead at 98","main":"Dorothy Height, Largely Unsung Giant of the Civil Rights Era, Dies at 98","print_headline":"Dorothy Height, Largely Unsung Giant of the Civil Rights Era, Dies at 98"},"pub_date":"2010-04-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Obituary","_id":"5400b8c838f0d841b2f38625"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/06\/world\/asia\/seeking-the-right-to-be-female-in-malaysia.html","snippet":"In a case that their lawyers believe could have an effect beyond the state where it was filed, four Malaysians born male are seeking to overturn a law punishing them for dressing as women....","lead_paragraph":"In a case that their lawyers believe could have an effect beyond the state where it was filed, four Malaysians born male are seeking to overturn a law punishing them for dressing as women.","abstract":"Four Malaysians born male seek to overturn law punishing them for dressing as women; group of transgender people, tired of living in fear, argue Shariah, or Islamic law, violates the Constitution, which bans discrimination on gender and protects freedom of expression.","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Seeking the Right to Be Female in Malaysia","print_headline":"Transgender Malaysians Challenge Religious Laws"},"pub_date":"2012-10-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Asia Pacific","type_of_material":"News","_id":"507c4f8495e998af711866b8"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1964\/05\/04\/methodist-backs-rights-protests.html","snippet":null,"lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"METHODIST BACKS RIGHTS PROTESTS"},"pub_date":"1964-05-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"535ed5b138f0d82813917606"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/05\/24\/magazine\/re-the-witnesses.html","snippet":"Weighing the role of social media in a movement and the role of a journalist in covering it....","lead_paragraph":"Weighing the role of social media in a movement and the role of a journalist in covering it.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Re: The Witnesses","content_kicker":"The Thread","kicker":"The Thread","print_headline":"Re: The Witnesses"},"pub_date":"2015-05-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"555f0c3a38f0d86bef1f67dd"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/07\/magazine\/how-a-fractious-womens-movement-came-to-lead-the-left.html","snippet":"Feminism brought the opposition together.

The New Jersey Division of Civil Rights ruled this week that the clubs' ties to the university render them public accommodations and therefore subject to the same law concerning discrimination as the university. The decision came in a five-year-old complaint by Sally Frank, a 1980 Princeton graduate whose requests to join the eating clubs were rejected in 1979. The decision, which established state jurisdiction over the clubs, is not binding, but will probably result in an order by the division for the clubs to consider women for admission, according to the participants.
