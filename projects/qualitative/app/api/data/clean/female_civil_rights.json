The study contradicts a report drafted by the staff of the commission, which said such programs were ineffective. The new study focused on a $2.2 billion project to improve the main Amtrak rail line running through eight states in the Northeast Corridor, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Because of 10 years of strong commitment from top officials at Amtrak and the Federal Transportation Department, the study said, this project surpassed its goal of awarding 15 percent of all contracts to businesses owned by blacks, Hispanic people and women.

The Michigan prison system has been the subject of extensive press coverage and outside scrutiny for allegations of sexual assaults against women inmates.
