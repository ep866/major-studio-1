But the technique will not work for pork farmers, because pig sperm does not stand freezing, and artificial insemination is of limited use with horses, because horse sperm can be refrigerated only briefly. But now a Gulph Mills, Pa., company that specializes in commercializing biotechnology patents is working on a method of preserving sperm that requires no refrigeration. The company, British Technology Group USA, uses a polymer gel to encapsulate the sperm. At room temperature, the polymer solidifies, immobilizing the sperm and lowering their metabolic activity. The polymer is permeable, letting oxygen in and waste products out. Because it is encapsulated in the polymer, the sperm can be sent through the mail. In the case of cows and mice -- the only species for which the technology has been demonstrated so far -- the sperm can survive up to 21 days.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Mail-Order Mates With a Biotech Twist","kicker":"BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY"},"pub_date":"1991-11-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1c9958eb7c8105d6fcca7"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/01\/06\/technology\/daily-report-the-next-voice-you-hear-will-be-amazons.html","snippet":"The company is in the middle of a push to get Alexa, its voice-activated assistant, in cars, appliance and more.

''Take Back the Decks: An Evening of Women in Underground Music'' presented female D.J.'s and rappers to a female-dominated audience that recalled Lilith Fair. On one important level this evening did Lilith one better. Male backing musicians outnumbered the female stars at that much-admired festival. ''Take Back the Decks'' featured pure female artistry. Technology, that old reliable liberator, made the leap possible. Machine-generated hip-hop and dance music can be created by a D.J. or turntablist alone, or in league with a vocalist. Instead of casting around for a female drummer, bassist and guitarist, an aspiring rapper can simply partner with a female turntablist. Or that turntablist can create a show all by herself.","abstract":"Ann Powers reviews program of women in underground music, including DJ's and rappers, at Lighthouse Frying Pan; photo (M)","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Lessons for the Sisterhood In Turntable Wizardry","kicker":"POP REVIEW"},"pub_date":"2000-05-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd23d4a8eb7c8105d7d3061"},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/14\/t-magazine\/art\/anicka-yi.html","snippet":"She has used tempura-fried flowers, incorporated smell, and injected live snails with oxytocin....","lead_paragraph":"She has used tempura-fried flowers, incorporated smell, and injected live snails with oxytocin.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Anicka Yi Is Inventing a New Kind of Conceptual Art","kicker":"","print_headline":"Burn After Reading","content_kicker":""},"pub_date":"2017-02-14T16:02:12+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"TStyle","section_name":"T Magazine","subsection_name":"Art","type_of_material":"News","_id":"58a32a0c95d0e02474636616"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/bits.blogs.nytimes.com\/2015\/12\/11\/daily-report-machines-outdo-humans-in-identifying-characters\/","snippet":"A so-called computer-vision program was able to outperform humans in identifying handwritten characters.
