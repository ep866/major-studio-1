Less talked about is another ''digital divide,'' the fact that fewer women are entering today's booming technology fields. Studies show that women are active users of the new technology and that female Internet users slightly outnumber male users. But the paucity of women creating that technology is cause for concern. The most recent National Science Foundation statistics show that between 1984 and 1997, the proportion of women receiving bachelor's degrees in computer science dropped from 37 percent to 27 percent.
