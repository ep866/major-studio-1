Politicians report that what they call the gender gap is showing up widely in campaigns from coast to coast. Their campaign polls usually find Democrats getting more support from women while Republicans have more backing from men, but women vote in greater numbers than men. Facing this unaccustomed divergence, both parties are concentrating on women. Although they share some tactics, such as greater use of daytime television, the parties argue over whether the Reagan Administration's economic and budget policies have hit women hardest. Many Republicans are seeking to shield themselves from the effects of women's dislike for the Administration, shown repeatedly in national polls, by emphasizing education or the elderly in their campaigns.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"MALE-FEMALE SPLIT ON POLITICS FOUND A KEY FACTOR IN

Hardly an amorphous time to 51 percent of the population, that decade brought Title IX and the legalization of abortion, introduced ''domestic violence'' as a term (and created a network of shelters for battered women), and saw women infiltrating all-male colleges and all-male professions -- to name a few things. This reminds me of a recent debate at the United States Postal Service. The people there were trying to figure out if they should include women's liberation as one of their stamps representing the 70's.

When it was pointed out by a startled and wounded fan that \"West Side Story\" was a variation on \"Romeo and Juliet,\" a play originally created by a \"successful white male\" who was neither Italian nor a citizen of Verona, the speaker denounced William Shakespeare as a racist.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"The Crime of White Maleness"},"pub_date":"1991-08-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd19bf38eb7c8105d6aca83"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/06\/books\/review\/generation-revolution-rachel-aspden.html","snippet":"\u201cGeneration Revolution\u201d by Rachel Aspden shows that the young in Egypt are improbably looking forward and backward at the same time....","lead_paragraph":"\u201cGeneration Revolution\u201d by Rachel Aspden shows that the young in Egypt are improbably looking forward and backward at the same time.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"\u2018Generation Revolution\u2019: Why Youth Was Not Enough in Egypt","content_kicker":"Nonfiction","kicker":"Nonfiction","print_headline":"Youth Was Not Enough"},"pub_date":"2017-02-06T12:00:01+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"BookReview","section_name":"Books","subsection_name":"Book Review","type_of_material":"Review","_id":"5898654695d0e0392607ed29"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/india.blogs.nytimes.com\/2012\/01\/03\/a-long-wait-for-equality-in-parliament\/","snippet":"A bill to increase female representation in Parliament is on hold, again....","lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":"A bill to increase female representation in Parliament is on hold, again.","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"A Long Wait for Equality in Parliament","kicker":"India Ink"},"pub_date":"2012-01-03T23:50:39Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Asia Pacific","type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"54f3236738f0d8529ba3601e"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/03\/29\/opinion\/l29ferraro.html","snippet":"A reader responds to coverage of Geraldine Ferraro\u2019s death....","lead_paragraph":"A reader responds to coverage of Geraldine Ferraro\u2019s death.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Ferraro\u2019s Legacy","kicker":"Letter","print_headline":"Ferraro\u2019s Legacy","content_kicker":"Letter"},"pub_date":"2011-03-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Letters","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"540c31a938f0d85e13e4d0c3"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1987\/06\/14\/books\/l-dworkin-s-arguments-465187.html","snippet":"LEAD:  To the Editor:...","lead_paragraph":"LEAD: To the Editor:","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Dworkin's Arguments"},"pub_date":"1987-06-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Book Review Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books; Opinion","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd16ab98eb7c8105d65b7c1"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2017\/01\/25\/us\/ap-us-womens-march-social-media-protest.html","snippet":"A school board member in Hillary Clinton's hometown resigned after making a derogatory reference on Twitter to the female anatomy in describing women marching against President Donald Trump.

Translated by Margaret Sayers Peden. 274 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $17.95.    FEW literary legends can compare to that surrounding ''The House of the Spirits,'' Isabel Allende's family-chronicle-cum-history of her native Chile. Her very first novel, published when she was in her early 40's, rose to best-sellerdom. Reviewers were indulgent. Here was a beautiful, humane, talented woman who happened to be the exiled niece of the martyred Chilean President Salvador Allende. The troublesome secret was that in prose and format the book was mostly imitation Garcia Marquez.   Happily, Ms. Allende is no longer the novice in ''Of Love and Shadows,'' a suspenseful thriller. Set in the terrorized Chile of Gen. Augusto Pinochet (himself an occasional character), it tells of the love that grows between Irene Beltran - feisty, innocent, marginally upper-class and a reporter for a women's magazine - and Francisco Leal, son of impoverished Spanish Republican exiles, an unemployed psychologist and sometime political activist who casually drifts into Irene's office as a freelance photographer. Together they cover a variety of beats, but something clicks when they start investigating Evangelina, a 15-year-old peasant girl and fabled miracle worker. During a brutal army search of her family's house, Evangelina, in a trance, singlehandedly lifts up a cruel lieutenant and hurls him out the door.   Soon thereafter Evangelina ''disappears''; through journalistic tips and footwork the hero and heroine locate the girl's corpse in an abandoned mine shaft, where bodies of dozens of the regime's opponents are also decaying. Francisco takes photos; word spreads; a scandal ensues. Then someone sprays Irene with bullets from a passing car. She survives in the hospital but is obviously marked for Government liquidation. With help from friends she and Francisco assume disguises, quietly flee Santiago and cross the Andes into Argentina, ready to fight the dictatorship from exile. ''We will return,'' they say. LOVE and struggle a la ''Casablanca'' - it's all there. Ms. Allende skillfully evokes both the terrors of daily life under military rule and the subtler forms of resistance in the hidden corners and ''shadows'' of her title, particularly in the churches or in simple unsung acts of solidarity. At the same time the author ably captures the voices of the regime's apologists - the complex lies and cliches of its proud male foot soldiers and the pat false phrases of its rich lady cheerleaders. A journalist herself, Ms. Allende renders with expert detail such offbeat worlds as the professional routines of a hairdresser, the range of types in a private nursing home or the operations of the Santiago city morgue. While her prose at times verges on soap opera, that is also one of its charms. She can just as deftly depict loving tenderness as convey the high fire of eroticism. And when you've successfully mingled sex and politics with a noble cause, how can you go wrong?   While the translation by Margaret Sayers Peden is at times awkward (for example, ''pythoness'' and ''chiromancy'' instead of ''fortune teller'' and ''palmistry'') and could use more colloqualisms and contractions, on the whole it's a supple piece of work."},"pub_date":"1987-07-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Book Review Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd187478eb7c8105d6866cf"},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2017\/02\/27\/us\/ap-us-oscars.html","snippet":"The 89th Academy Awards got off on the right foot, with a song and dance, but ended with the most stunning mistake ever to befall the esteemed awards show when the best picture Oscar was presented to the wrong movie.

''It opened cartoonists up to what the possibilities of the medium were. It showed how zany comics could be. It had a profound influence on every great underground cartoonist, from Robert Crumb to S. Clay Wilson.''<\/p>\n<p>And the influence, these cartoonists said, extended into American society. The legions of young boys (the readership has been overwhelmingly male) who would religiously read the magazine were taught how to thumb their noses at authority.<\/p>\n<p>''Mad was more important than pot and LSD in shaping the generation that protested the Vietnam War,'' Mr. Spiegelman, a staff writer and cartoonist for The New Yorker, once said.

Even the glories of classic verse turn banal: ''In Levittown did Irving Kahn\/ A lovely Cape Cod house decree.''<\/p>\n<p>So for the Mad writers, Alfred's is the moronic face left when authority is stripped of all pretense. But it is also the unfazed visage of the ''gang of idiots'' creating and reading the magazine, who are treated like clods by the surrounding world, but are really immune to its surreptitious designs. The unknowing child with the unyielding smile helps unmask adult venality: Mad's features often transformed children's forms -- nursery rhymes and reading primers -- into sardonic commentaries on adult life.<\/p>\n<p>In all this Alfred E. Neuman helped enshrine the dominant view we still have of the conformist 1950s. And as Mad's editor once explained, the magazine eventually helped shape the 1960s counterculture. But by the late 1970s these notions of opposition had themselves become mainstream. What pretensions could Mad puncture without repeating itself? Young adolescents hardly needed to be tutored in distrusting authority. American popular culture had become a culture of opposition and satire.

Pomposity was ridiculed (recall the Ministry of Silly Walks) but so was the pretense of pointing out pomposity. All forms of politics dissolve into a kind of comic nihilism. The comedy is born not from the brain of a Neumanesque child, but from the minds of hyper-educated adults, who know enough to depend on very little.<\/p>\n<p>But despite our saturation with satire, there have still been targets that come into view in Mad (''Did he need the triple bypass?'' a credit card advertisement asks of a patient undergoing surgery.

Only one method, the century-old condom, is both as effective and safe as some of the contraceptives available to women. The outlook for male contraceptives is not much brighter. A report by The Alan Guttmacher Institute, issued just over a week ago, outlined 11 new birth control techniques ''on the horizon''; only two were for men. Even those - gossypol, a cottonseed oil derivative that interferes with sperm production, and synthetic forms of the brain hormone LHRH, which turns off testicular function - have at least eight years of experimentation and testing before they are commercially viable, assuming their serious side effects can be circumvented. The World Health Organization has said it might be more than 20 years before a new male contraceptive is marketable.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"WHY A LAG IN MALE-ORIENTED BIRTH CONTROL?"},"pub_date":"1983-10-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Health; Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd12f6d8eb7c8105d5fbcad"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9D05E0DA1731EE3BBC4952DFBF668382649EDE","snippet":"TRENTON, Sept. 10 -- Gov.
