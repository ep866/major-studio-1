Politicians report that what they call the gender gap is showing up widely in campaigns from coast to coast. Their campaign polls usually find Democrats getting more support from women while Republicans have more backing from men, but women vote in greater numbers than men. Facing this unaccustomed divergence, both parties are concentrating on women. Although they share some tactics, such as greater use of daytime television, the parties argue over whether the Reagan Administration's economic and budget policies have hit women hardest. Many Republicans are seeking to shield themselves from the effects of women's dislike for the Administration, shown repeatedly in national polls, by emphasizing education or the elderly in their campaigns.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"MALE-FEMALE SPLIT ON POLITICS FOUND A KEY FACTOR IN POLLS"},"pub_date":"1982-10-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"Front Page; U.S.; Washington","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd12a928eb7c8105d5f31d0"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9A0CE2DD1439E533A25751C1A9609C94649FD7CF","snippet":"To the Editor of the Springfield (Mass.)
