They note that the figures in this study, based on 1994 data, are four times higher than estimates of domestic abuse reported in another major survey. Such violence ''appears to be on the rise,'' said Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National Organization for Women. But this interpretation of the new study is misleading. The most important finding is that of all the women who went to an emergency room for any reason -- roughly 47 million in 1994 -- only half of 1 percent, or around 200,000, sought emergency treatment for injuries resulting from domestic violence. This debunks the claim, widely cited by policy makers and women's groups, that up to a third of women who visit emergency rooms do so because they were assaulted by a current or former partner.","abstract":"Sally L Satel Op-Ed article accuses feminists of distorting new study of domestic violence by Bureau of Justice Statistics to reach conclusion that violence against women is even worse than they thought; photo (M)","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Feminist Number Games"},"pub_date":"1997-09-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd1d7e88eb7c8105d716007"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2000\/04\/16\/opinion\/l-when-women-turn-to-violence-803723.html","snippet":"To the Editor:    Your April 9-12 front-page series ''Rampage Killers'' supplies a factual baseline from which to consider the recent school shootings and brings due attention to the understudied issue of violence committed by women....","lead_paragraph":"To the Editor: Your April 9-12 front-page series ''Rampage Killers'' supplies a factual baseline from which to consider the recent school shootings and brings due attention to the understudied issue of violence committed by women.","abstract":"Cindy D Ness letter on understudied issue of violence committed by women, who comprise 14 percenet of violent offenders (S)","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"When Women Turn to Violence"},"pub_date":"2000-04-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd213528eb7c8105d78a176"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/07\/09\/us\/girls-in-juvenile-facilities-often-abused-report-says.html","snippet":"As many as 80 percent of the girls in some states\u2019 juvenile justice systems have been sexually or physically abused, and facilities lack the means to address their trauma....","lead_paragraph":"As many as 80 percent of the girls in some states\u2019 juvenile justice systems have been sexually or physically abused, and facilities lack the means to address their trauma.","abstract":"Report by Human Rights Project for Girls, in conjunction with other organizations, finds as many as 80 percent of girls in some states' juvenile justice systems have history of physical or sexual abuse; report recommends that girls who have been sexually trafficked no longer be arrested on prostitution charges.","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"History of Abuse Seen in Many Girls in Juvenile System","print_headline":"Girls in Justice System Often Abused, Report Says"},"pub_date":"2015-07-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"559df20638f0d8355a0629fb"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/05\/04\/opinion\/l-most-violence-against-women-isn-t-domestic-869893.html","snippet":"To the Editor:   \"Muggings in the Kitchen\" (editorial, April 23) says that \"an American woman is beaten by her husband or boyfriend every 15 seconds.\" At that rate, 21 million women would be beaten by their husbands or boyfriends every year.

That is simply not the case. Statistics from the Department of Justice National Crime Survey show only 56,000 cases of violence suffered by female victims that were reportedly caused by a spouse. An additional 216,000 violent acts were perpetrated by a former spouse; 198,000 by a boyfriend or former boyfriend. There were 696,800 assaults from another \"person whom victim knew\" and 1.13 million from a stranger. The total from the Justice Department's survey, including strangers, is approximately one-tenth the number your editorial cites: 2.2 million cases.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Most Violence Against Women Isn't Domestic"},"pub_date":"1993-05-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd1ddc68eb7c8105d720711"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1999\/04\/11\/weekinreview\/april-4-10-a-guilty-plea-in-the-kidnapping-and-murder-of-a-gay-man.html","snippet":"In Laramie, Wyoming, where the murder of Matthew Shepard six months ago provoked national soul-searching over violence against gay people, Russell A.
