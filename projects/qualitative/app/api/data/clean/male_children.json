One of the men, Hu Minghua, 55, was convicted of kidnapping and selling nine children. Five of the children, all boys now 3 to 6 years old, have been returned to their families, while the parents of the remaining ones have not been found. The other man, Su Binde, 27, was convicted of abducting six children. Five of those children were rescued by the police, while a sixth remains missing. Child trafficking is a big problem in China, where the traditional preference for male heirs and a restrictive one-child policy have driven a thriving market in baby boys, who sell for much more than girls. Girls and women are abducted and often used as laborers or as brides for unwed sons.","abstract":"China executes Hu Minghua and Su Binde for abducting and selling 15 children, many who were taken as babies or toddlers; five children, all boys, have been returned to their families; child trafficking is big problem in China, where traditional preference for male heirs and one-child policy drive thriving market for boys (S)","blog":[],"source":"AP","headline":{"main":"China: 2 Executed For Child Abductions","kicker":"WORLD BRIEFING | ASIA"},"pub_date":"2009-11-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2b5e98eb7c8105d8a9bb0"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2016\/07\/25\/us\/ap-us-stun-gun-on-kids.html","snippet":"Authorities in Florida say four adults have been arrested for using a stun gun to discipline children living in their home....","lead_paragraph":"Authorities in Florida say four adults have been arrested for using a stun gun to discipline children living in their home.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","headline":{"main":"Deputies: Men Shocked Kids With Stun Gun for Pushup Failures","print_headline":"Deputies: Men Shocked Kids With Stun Gun for Pushup Failures"},"pub_date":"2016-07-25T14:33:11Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"57965cf538f0d84855eae76a"},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/20\/books\/review-the-one-inside-presents-sam-shepard-in-a-minor-key.html","snippet":"This new volume, labeled a work of fiction, provides a sharp-edged distillation of the themes that have preoccupied him throughout his career....","lead_paragraph":"This new volume, labeled a work of fiction, provides a sharp-edged distillation of the themes that have preoccupied him throughout his career.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Review: \u2018The One Inside\u2019 Presents Sam Shepard in a Minor Key","kicker":"Books of The Times","print_headline":" Tales Told in a Minor Key","content_kicker":"Books of The Times"},"pub_date":"2017-02-20T22:00:38+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Culture","section_name":"Books","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"58ab670b95d0e02474637a33"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/12\/18\/opinion\/l-divorced-fathers-protesting-too-much-106695.html","snippet":"To the Editor:     Are we to commiserate with male parents who claim their civil rights are being abused because their tax refunds are being withheld to satisfy child-support obligations?
