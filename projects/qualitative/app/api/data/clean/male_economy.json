Unemployment and inflation rates are at record lows, and low-paid workers are, for the first time in decades, receiving wage increases that outpace price increases. But despite the benefits of a temporarily buoyant economy, deep-seated problems remain. Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, notes that the best time to tackle problems is when the economy is flush. He points to increasing inequality at a time of stagnating wages in his new book, ''The New Dollars and Dreams'' (Russell Sage Foundation, 1998). Borrowing a phrase from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Mr. Levy warns against ''defining deviancy down -- accepting economic outcomes as normal today that would have been seen as pathological 10 or 20 years ago.''","abstract":"Deep-seated problems remain despite benefits of temporary buoyant economy; discussion of five profound problems facing American economy: income inequality, wealth inequality, sluggish productivity, education gap and tattered safety blanket; drawing (M)","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"5 Problems Tarnishing a Robust Economy","kicker":"OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY -- ECONOMIC SCENE"},"pub_date":"1999-01-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Education; Business","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1e8198eb7c8105d7360fe"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/ideas.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/06\/29\/the-great-he-cession\/","snippet":"Monday | Today's idea: The recession -- ironically brought on by risky macho behavior -- is hastening the decline of men as job sectors favoring women remain relatively unscathed. \"We have no precedent for a world after the death of macho,\" an art...","lead_paragraph":"Today's idea: The recession -- brought on by risky macho behavior -- is hastening the decline of men as job sectors favoring women remain relatively unscathed. \"We have no precedent for a world after the death of macho,\" an article says.

''There are always retailers who expand too fast, or take on too much debt,'' he said. ''It's a fickle area of the economy.''
