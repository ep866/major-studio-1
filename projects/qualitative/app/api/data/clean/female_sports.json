Bobbe was born on May 16, 1916, in the hardscrabble mining town of Bisbee, AZ, and moved with her parents to Beverly Hills when Sunset Boulevard had yet to be fully paved. She was a successful business woman in the 1940s, when female entrepreneurs were a rare breed, and through the 1980s, as women increasingly rose to prominence in corporate America. She found great success in commercial and residential real estate as well in public relations. In the 1950s she handled Mark Taper's PR for his ambitious Lakewood development. With Coldwell Banker, Bobbe sold many of the more remarkable Los Angeles homes of her time, remarkable both for their lavishness and their residents. Bobbe was also an outdoors woman and athlete, fishing and riding horses. She skied and played tennis competitively, often against men. She raised and trained dogs and was a sports car enthusiast, well-known for the rainbow-painted Porsche in which she made her real estate rounds. Bobbe traveled widely throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. As a patron of the arts she greatly enjoyed classical music and in recent years, Lady Gaga. Her rapier wit and playful sense of humor was matched by her care and concern for others. Never one to talk about herself, Bobbe focused her incandescent personality on whomever she was with; her joyful presence absorbed as much as her quiet smile radiated. Bobbe leaves behind friends and classmates from Beverly Hills High School (1935, Class President), UC Berkeley and UCLA (1939, BA European History). She will be dearly missed by her family, including her niece Jeanne Meyers (Richard Carr) and nephews Charles Franklin (Susie) and Wayne Franklin (Susan); her grandnieces and nephews, Elissa (Clark Middleton) and Lucas Meyers (Margaret); Zachary Franklin (Sofia Zander), Seth Franklin (Kristin), Judd Franklin (Tybe Goldberg); and Jason Franklin, Barrett Franklin (Lea) and Shannon Hegarty (Terry); as well as by her great grandnieces and nephew, Ellington and August Meyers; Molly Franklin and Clara Zander; and Adena Franklin. Bobbe was predeceased by her younger brothers Benny (Ben Jr.) (same day as Bobbe, February 28, but 1973) and Maynard Franklin (2011). Beneficiaries of Babette's profoundly philanthropic nature include several health and educational institutes. She and her brother Maynard left the gem and mineral collection originally amassed by their parents, Ben and Clara, in Bisbee, to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, where it can now be seen by all. 1","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Memorials  FRANKENBERG, BABETTE MEYERS KNOWN TO HER FAMILY AND MANY FRIENDS AS \"BOBBE,\" DIED FEBRUARY 28 AT AGE 98, HAVING LIVED A RICHLY VARIEGATED AND ADVENTUROUS LIFE THAT CHANNELED HER PIONEERING SPIRIT AS A FEMINIST BEFORE HER TIME.

She now works with other senior managers to guide the integration of print and Web journalists and newsroom processes.<\/p>\n<p>Until April of 2007, Ms. Mifflin was the Executive Director of Television and Video for The Times, supervising all projects that involve The Times in television and Web video.  The department produces original video journalism for nytimes.com, the leading newspaper Web site and one of the most popular news and information Web sites in the world.<\/p>\n<p>She also supervised the production of television documentaries involving The Times, including several that won top broadcast journalism awards. After the launch of the Discovery Times Channel in March, 2003, her responsibilities included overseeing all content for that digital cable network, a joint venture of Discovery Communications, Inc., and The New York Times.  That joint venture ended in April, 2006.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"More\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\">Read More...<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n\n<p>From March 1995 until moving into The Times&#185;s television enterprises division in 1999, Ms. Mifflin covered television and other media news as a reporter for The Times. Previously, she created the Company&#185;s work-life services office, in the human resources department, serving as its director from March 1993 until March 1995. Before that, she served as an editor on the national desk and national education editor from 1990 to 1993, and as deputy sports editor from 1984 to 1990.  She began her career at the paper as a sports reporter in 1982.<\/p>\n<p>Before joining The Times, Ms. Mifflin worked for a year as an associate producer at ABC Sports, and from 1974 to 1981 was a reporter for The New York Daily News. She was that paper&#185;s first female sportswriter.<\/p>\n<p>Born in Philadelphia in 1951, Ms. Mifflin was a member of the first class of undergraduate women to be accepted by Yale University.  She graduated in 1973, with a degree in history. While there, she and a classmate organized the field hockey team, which in 1972 became one of Yale&#185;s first three varsity sports for women.  She went on to receive a master&#185;s degree in journalism from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1974.<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Mifflin was one of the first female sportswriters to work on a major metropolitan newspaper.  After two years as a city desk reporter for The News, she became a sportswriter there in 1976.  She has covered the major sports, as well as three Summer Olympics, the Lake Placid Winter Olympics, and, as a soccer specialist, two World Cup tournaments.<\/p>\n<p>In 2002, the PBS Nova documentary \"Bioterror,\" on which she served as co-executive producer, won an Emmy Award, The Times&#185;s first news and documentary Emmy. She was also co-executive producer on two PBS Frontline documentaries that won the Alfred I DuPont-Columbia University silver baton: \"A Dangerous Business\" (2004), which also won a George Foster Peabody Award, the Goldsmith Investigative Reporting Prize and, in combination with the articles in The Times, the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for public service; and \"The Secret History of the Credit Card\" (2005), which also won an Emmy.  Her department won a third duPont-Columbia silver baton in 2006, for \"Nuclear Jihad,\" a documentary co-produced by The Times, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Discovery Times.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"Hide\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more');
