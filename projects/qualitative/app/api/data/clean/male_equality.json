Johnson, a case involving battery manufacture. Ms. Rosen deplores the \"impoverishment of the language of individual rights\" and the \"skewed\" framework created by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination. She suggests the \"inadequacy of liberal feminism\" is to blame for hazardous workplaces. This analysis misapprehends the legal system and the facts of this case. The Court was asked to decide only whether barring fertile women from exposure to the lead in batteries, a hazard to fetal health, was impermissible sex discrimination. It was filed as a sex discrimination case because that was the strongest, if not only, legal claim available. It was not filed as an occupational safety and health case because workers cannot sue to enforce Federal occupational safety and health law.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"No Worker Should Face Unacceptable Choices"},"pub_date":"1991-04-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd19e208eb7c8105d6b0d7b"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/03\/20\/arts\/documentary-on-women-in-sports.html","snippet":"EQUALITY under the hoop, on the gridiron and around the diamond - that's the theme of a half-hour ''Currents'' documentary called ''Settling the Score,'' tonight at 8:30 on WNET\/ Channel 13.

The two most successful career women I know are both married to men who stay home with their children. Is this too revolutionary an arrangement for us? Why do most women, even those who earn salaries in the top 5 percent, still hope to find a mate who earns more? As long as we hold onto the male ''provider'' role as an ideal, we will have a tough time finding equality anywhere. I know several men whose real dream would be to stay home and raise children but are afraid to admit it because it is such a societal taboo. Aren't these the men that future female lawyers, doctors and math professors should be seeking out?
