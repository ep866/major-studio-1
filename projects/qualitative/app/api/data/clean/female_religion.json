The flirtation between the secular and the sacred has traditionally set off alarm bells among American academics, who have often regarded any intrusion of religion into politics as dangerous. In the last century, intellectual giants like John Dewey and Sigmund Freud dismissed religion as infantile and predicted an increasingly secular modern society. In his book ''Human Nature and Conduct'' (Henry Holt, 1922), Dewey said of religion, ''It has been petrified into a slavery of thought and sentiment, as intolerant superiority on the part of the few and an intolerable burden on the part of the many.''","abstract":"Growing number of social scientists, philosophers, historians and other scholars are trying to account for energetic re-entry of religion into public sphere, and some are viewing it with much delight as distress; philosopher Michael Novak, Rev Richard John Neuhaus, University of Chicago Prof Jean Bethke Elshtain, Michael Cromartie, vice president of Ethics and Public Policy Center, University of Tennessee Prof Wilfred M McClay, George Mason University Prof Hugh Helco, Center for Inquiry chairman Paul Kurtz and author Wendy Kaminer comment; drawing (M)","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"The Secular Society Gets Religion"},"pub_date":"2002-08-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts & Ideas\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Washington","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd238e48eb7c8105d7cc384"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/12\/25\/world\/americas\/nearly-in-ruins-the-church-where-sages-dreamed-of-a-modern-brazil.html","snippet":"The Positivist Church of Brazil, established by freethinkers from the Religion of Humanity, is another example of Rio\u2019s letting its history and grandeur fall into disrepair....","lead_paragraph":"The Positivist Church of Brazil, established by freethinkers from the Religion of Humanity, is another example of Rio\u2019s letting its history and grandeur fall into disrepair.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Nearly in Ruins: The Church Where Sages Dreamed of a Modern Brazil","content_kicker":"Rio de Janeiro Journal","kicker":"Rio de Janeiro Journal","print_headline":"Nearly in Ruins: A Temple for the Sages"},"pub_date":"2016-12-25T22:49:34+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Americas","type_of_material":"News","_id":"58604d0795d0e03926077c1f"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/10\/14\/world\/thai-monk-blazes-path-for-equality-for-women.html","snippet":"Chatsumarn Kabilsingh gave up her husband, family life and a distinguished career to walk the path of Buddha.

The flirtation between the secular and the sacred has traditionally set off alarm bells among American academics, who have often regarded any intrusion of religion into politics as dangerous. In the last century, intellectual giants like John Dewey and Sigmund Freud dismissed religion as infantile and predicted an increasingly secular modern society. In his book ''Human Nature and Conduct'' (Henry Holt, 1922), Dewey said of religion, ''It has been petrified into a slavery of thought and sentiment, as intolerant superiority on the part of the few and an intolerable burden on the part of the many.''","abstract":"Growing number of social scientists, philosophers, historians and other scholars are trying to account for energetic re-entry of religion into public sphere, and some are viewing it with much delight as distress; philosopher Michael Novak, Rev Richard John Neuhaus, University of Chicago Prof Jean Bethke Elshtain, Michael Cromartie, vice president of Ethics and Public Policy Center, University of Tennessee Prof Wilfred M McClay, George Mason University Prof Hugh Helco, Center for Inquiry chairman Paul Kurtz and author Wendy Kaminer comment; drawing (M)","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"The Secular Society Gets Religion"},"pub_date":"2002-08-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts & Ideas\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Washington","subsection_name":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd238e48eb7c8105d7cc384"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/12\/25\/world\/americas\/nearly-in-ruins-the-church-where-sages-dreamed-of-a-modern-brazil.html","snippet":"The Positivist Church of Brazil, established by freethinkers from the Religion of Humanity, is another example of Rio\u2019s letting its history and grandeur fall into disrepair....","lead_paragraph":"The Positivist Church of Brazil, established by freethinkers from the Religion of Humanity, is another example of Rio\u2019s letting its history and grandeur fall into disrepair.","abstract":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","headline":{"main":"Nearly in Ruins: The Church Where Sages Dreamed of a Modern Brazil","content_kicker":"Rio de Janeiro Journal","kicker":"Rio de Janeiro Journal","print_headline":"Nearly in Ruins: A Temple for the Sages"},"pub_date":"2016-12-25T22:49:34+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Americas","type_of_material":"News","_id":"58604d0795d0e03926077c1f"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/10\/14\/world\/thai-monk-blazes-path-for-equality-for-women.html","snippet":"Chatsumarn Kabilsingh gave up her husband, family life and a distinguished career to walk the path of Buddha.

(Sept. 15), is not so simple as you suggest. Questions involving apparent conflict between religious belief and law never are. The Hasidim claim that the right to practice their religion is compromised by female drivers transporting male students. Ample precedent supports the legal position that their claim is not automatically overridden by Federal law that prohibits discrimination on account of sex. This is also true even though the female drivers base their claim for certain bus runs on seniority provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Nor is the fact that the busing is provided from public funds dispositive.
