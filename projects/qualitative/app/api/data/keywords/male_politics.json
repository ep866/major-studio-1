LOVE AND SHADOWS (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"ALLENDE, ISABEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOK REVIEWS"}],"headline":{"main":"EROS MAKES WAR By Isabel Allende. Translated by Margaret Sayers Peden. 274 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $17.95.    FEW literary legends can compare to that surrounding ''The House of the Spirits,'' Isabel Allende's family-chronicle-cum-history of her native Chile. Her very first novel, published when she was in her early 40's, rose to best-sellerdom. Reviewers were indulgent. Here was a beautiful, humane, talented woman who happened to be the exiled niece of the martyred Chilean President Salvador Allende. The troublesome secret was that in prose and format the book was mostly imitation Garcia Marquez.   Happily, Ms. Allende is no longer the novice in ''Of Love and Shadows,'' a suspenseful thriller. Set in the terrorized Chile of Gen. Augusto Pinochet (himself an occasional character), it tells of the love that grows between Irene Beltran - feisty, innocent, marginally upper-class and a reporter for a women's magazine - and Francisco Leal, son of impoverished Spanish Republican exiles, an unemployed psychologist and sometime political activist who casually drifts into Irene's office as a freelance photographer. Together they cover a variety of beats, but something clicks when they start investigating Evangelina, a 15-year-old peasant girl and fabled miracle worker. During a brutal army search of her family's house, Evangelina, in a trance, singlehandedly lifts up a cruel lieutenant and hurls him out the door.   Soon thereafter Evangelina ''disappears''; through journalistic tips and footwork the hero and heroine locate the girl's corpse in an abandoned mine shaft, where bodies of dozens of the regime's opponents are also decaying. Francisco takes photos; word spreads; a scandal ensues. Then someone sprays Irene with bullets from a passing car. She survives in the hospital but is obviously marked for Government liquidation. With help from friends she and Francisco assume disguises, quietly flee Santiago and cross the Andes into Argentina, ready to fight the dictatorship from exile. ''We will return,'' they say. LOVE and struggle a la ''Casablanca'' - it's all there. Ms. Allende skillfully evokes both the terrors of daily life under military rule and the subtler forms of resistance in the hidden corners and ''shadows'' of her title, particularly in the churches or in simple unsung acts of solidarity. At the same time the author ably captures the voices of the regime's apologists - the complex lies and cliches of its proud male foot soldiers and the pat false phrases of its rich lady cheerleaders. A journalist herself, Ms. Allende renders with expert detail such offbeat worlds as the professional routines of a hairdresser, the range of types in a private nursing home or the operations of the Santiago city morgue. While her prose at times verges on soap opera, that is also one of its charms. She can just as deftly depict loving tenderness as convey the high fire of eroticism. And when you've successfully mingled sex and politics with a noble cause, how can you go wrong?   While the translation by Margaret Sayers Peden is at times awkward (for example, ''pythoness'' and ''chiromancy'' instead of ''fortune teller'' and ''palmistry'') and could use more colloqualisms and contractions, on the whole it's a supple piece of work."},"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1987\/07\/12\/books\/eros-makes-war-isabel-allende-translated-margaret-sayers-peden-274-pp-new-york.html","date":"1987-07-12T00:00:00Z","news_desk":"Book Review Desk"},{"keywords":[],"headline":{"main":"Oscars Flap Eclipses 'Moonlight' Win, but Civility Reigns","print_headline":"Oscars Flap Eclipses 'Moonlight' Win, but Civility Reigns"},"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2017\/02\/27\/us\/ap-us-oscars.html","date":"2017-02-27T10:33:43+0000","news_desk":"None"},{"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Children and Childhood"}],"headline":{"main":"Events for Children in NYC This Week","print_headline":"For Children"},"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/01\/19\/arts\/events-for-children-in-nyc-this-week.html","date":"2017-01-19T23:47:32+0000","news_desk":"Weekend"},{"keywords":[],"headline":{"main":"Mad Magazine"},"web_url":"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/organizations\/m\/mad_magazine\/index.html","date":null,"news_desk":null},{"keywords":[{"isMajor":"N","rank":1,"name":"subject","value":"Tennis"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":2,"name":"persons","value":"Sock, Jack"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":3,"name":"organizations","value":"Assn of Tennis Professionals"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":4,"name":"subject","value":"Davis Cup"}],"headline":{"main":"America\u2019s Top-Ranked Male Player, Jack Sock Is Dreaming Much Bigger","print_headline":"America\u2019s Top-Ranked Man Is Dreaming Much Bigger"},"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/27\/sports\/tennis\/jack-sock.html","date":"2017-02-28T02:08:02+0000","news_desk":"Sports"},{"keywords":[],"headline":{"main":"Mad Magazine"},"web_url":"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/topic\/organization\/mad-magazine","date":null,"news_desk":null},{"keywords":[{"isMajor":"N","rank":1,"name":"subject","value":"Classical Music"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":2,"name":"organizations","value":"Carnegie Hall"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":3,"name":"organizations","value":"Concerto Italiano"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":4,"name":"organizations","value":"Hesperion XXI"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":5,"name":"organizations","value":"Il Pomo D'Oro (Music Group)"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":6,"name":"organizations","value":"Venice Baroque Orchestra"}],"headline":{"main":"A Musical Handshake Spanning Centuries: Venice in New York","print_headline":"A Musical Handshake Spanning Centuries: Venice in New York"},"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/22\/arts\/music\/a-musical-handshake-spanning-centuries-venice-in-new-york.html","date":"2017-02-22T22:22:36+0000","news_desk":"Culture"},{"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","name":"organizations","value":"Balenciaga (Fashion Label)"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","name":"organizations","value":"Kering SA"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Fashion and Apparel"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","name":"persons","value":"Gvasalia, Demna"}],"headline":{"main":"Who Needs Pants?
