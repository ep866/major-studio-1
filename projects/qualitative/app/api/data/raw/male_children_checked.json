''That's what you get in South Jersey, when you get a divorce, you get charged with sex abuse,'' said Margaret E. Allen of Burlington City.   Miss Allen is the co-founder of the New Jersey chapter of VOCAL (Victims of Child Abuse Laws) and the fiancee of Christopher Clauss, who was arrested and charged with molesting his then 2 1\/2-year-old daughter on May 4, 1984. (The final divorce decree was granted May 14.) Mr. Clauss was later found not guilty in a Burlington County trial.   Miss Allen said that the charges against Mr. Clauss had stemmed from visitation difficulties with his former wife.   ''And you automatically lose your visitation rights,'' she said, ''and that's the way you lose custody, when you're charged with this.''   Miss Allen said that 90 percent of the 76 members of New Jersey VOCAL were involved in custody or visitation battles, had recently become involved with a new partner, or both. The chapter, formed in February 1985, was patterned after a group in Minnesota (there are reportedly 65 chapters in the country).   The New Jersey group is mostly male, but does include a few women accused of molestation and girlfriends and wives of men in the group. (Nearly all have been charged with abusing their own children, but some have been accused of molesting children they live with.) Miss Allen said that the state Department of Human Services' Division of Youth and Family Services, whose mandate is to protect children, did not follow proper procedure in investigations.   The division's actions, Mr. Clauss said, ''smack of Nazi Germany in 1933 and the McCarthy era.''   Geoffrey S. Perselay, the acting Human Services Commissioner, said of VOCAL: ''I'll quote from Shakespeare: 'Thou dost protest too much.' ''   ''There is a big difference,'' he said, ''between being 'not guilty' and being found 'not guilty' by a court, with the limitations on testimony. For example, the ability of a 2-year-old child, often your best witness, to express itself as to what occurred.''   ''It's frustrating as hell to sit here,'' he said, ''cloaked in confidentiality, being under court order not to disclose particular facts of a case, with no opportunity to defend ourselves. It's difficult enough to prosecute these cases and protect children, and then you have a group like this, trying to detract focus from the children.''   Senator Catherine A. Costa, Democrat of the Seventh District (parts of Burlington and Camden Counties), who has been meeting with members of VOCAL, said: ''It's a very serious situation. A lot of these people are really hurting bad. In some instances it's a means of gaining custody. It's a sad situation - extremely cruel. Full justice has to rise to the surface in cases of innocence.''   Elderly people, women with young children, the handicapped and the poor will have problems getting their food, nutrition, and health needs met when the Middlesex County Board of Social Services moves to the outskirts of New Brunswick from the downtown area, says Enrico De Gironimo, assistant coordinator of Community Outreach Program for Senior Adults, a Rutgers community mental-health agency, and a member of the central New Jersey Rainbow Coalition.   The coalition - comprising social workers, community activists and recipients of social services -has been protesting the move.   ''A lot of these people are walk-ins, or take the bus downtown,'' said Mr. De Gironimo, ''and it's part of the 'hidden agenda' of the New Brunswick gentrification effort to drive the poor out of sight.''   The lease on the social services building is held by Rutgers, which plans to take it over for its Mason Gross School of the Arts in June 1987; Rutgers, in turn, is being forced out of its present site for the school.   The recent decision to place the county's social services in a leased building on Route 27, bordering Franklin Township, was made by the county freeholders and the Board of Social Services. However, financing and decisions for the board are dictated by the freeholders, according to Mary L. Hollis, director of the Board of Social Services.   ''There will probably be some clients who will have some difficulty in getting there,'' Mrs. Hollis admitted. ''We have a considerable number of clients who walk in.''   According to Dorothy K. Power, deputy director of the Middlesex Board of Chosen Freeholders, ''there will be no hardship.''   ''It's a 3 1\/2-mile trip to the edge of town,'' she said, adding, ''We could have gone to Edison or Metuchen.''   Mrs. Power said the county was considering providing a small bus to pick up clients. ''Or they could mail things in, or call,'' she said. As for putting up a building in downtown New Brunswick, Mrs. Powers said, ''It would not be commercially feasible and there would be no parking spaces for the workers and the clients.''   Quentin Smith, a community consultant for the New Brunswick Outreach Center, a private nonprofit social-service agency, and spokesman for the coalition, said that the group was investigating the possibility of a class-action suit and would also use political and ''street'' tactics to deal with the issue.   ''Since they - the city and county policy makers - are making us, the poor and minority groups, uncomfortable - we'll have to make it difficult and uncomfortable for them, in terms of pickets and boycotts,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Additionally, we're planning a political response, when the coalition organizes its October convention, in terms of strategy for the 1986 election campaigns.''   Do you know the ''New Jersey connection'' for Lillian Moller Gilbreth, Carrie Bamberger Frank Fuld, Virginia Apgar, Ruth Cheney Streeter and Fanny Brice?   You can find the answers - and a lot more about many other women (53 in all) - in ''Eastern Her Story, 1986 Engagement Calendar,'' just off the press from Planned Parenthood of Northwest New Jersey, based in Morristown.   The 125-page book is filled with biographies of famous and not-so-famous contemporary and historical women in the Eastern states who have made contributions in the arts, sciences, government and other walks of life.   Decisions on whom to include were based on representation in geography, race, ethnic group, career, past and present figures, as well as proportions of well-known women and ''finds,'' as Jeff Brand, executive director of the Planned Parenthood affiliate, put it.   The calendars, which will be sold at $8.95 to raise funds, ''were a natural, in terms of celebrating contributions made by American women, and, at the same time, producing income for a women's health organization,'' Mr. Brand said.   For those who would like to get to know their ''finds'' a bit more, ample bibliographic material is provided.   ''We need to institutionalize our concern for the young,'' says State Senator Leanna Brown, Republican of Chatham.   Mrs. Brown, whose 26th District takes in parts of Morris and Passaic Counties, proposes to accomplish this by forming a new standing Senate committee on children. She plans to introduce a resolution calling for such a committee in the next legislative meeting.   ''When you have a standing legislative committee, you have hearings and linkages of how various programs can help,'' Mrs. Brown said, explaining that bills affecting children are now assigned to many committees and often get side-tracked in the bureaucratic maze.   For instance, she cited her own bills: One deals with discrimination against families with children in rental housing, the other creates an ombudsman for children. Both measures have not progressed.   A committee on children would be part of a three-pronged approach to children's issues, said Mrs. Brown. The proposed Governor's Commission on Youth and Families (recommended by an executive children's policy committee) would function as a recommender of policies; an ombudsman would follow the proposals through, at the executive level, and the legislative committee would implement legislation on children's issues.   A new standing committee can be created by resolution or by the more complicated change in rules, which would most likely not take place until the beginning of a new session"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd150258eb7c8105d630fa8","word_count":0,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/health.nytimes.com\/health\/guides\/disease\/reifenstein-syndrome\/overview.html","snippet":"Reifenstein syndrome is disease that occurs in boys when the body cannot respond the right way to the male sex hormones (androgens).
