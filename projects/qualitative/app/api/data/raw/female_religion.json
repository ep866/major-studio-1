The flirtation between the secular and the sacred has traditionally set off alarm bells among American academics, who have often regarded any intrusion of religion into politics as dangerous. In the last century, intellectual giants like John Dewey and Sigmund Freud dismissed religion as infantile and predicted an increasingly secular modern society. In his book ''Human Nature and Conduct'' (Henry Holt, 1922), Dewey said of religion, ''It has been petrified into a slavery of thought and sentiment, as intolerant superiority on the part of the few and an intolerable burden on the part of the many.''","abstract":"Growing number of social scientists, philosophers, historians and other scholars are trying to account for energetic re-entry of religion into public sphere, and some are viewing it with much delight as distress; philosopher Michael Novak, Rev Richard John Neuhaus, University of Chicago Prof Jean Bethke Elshtain, Michael Cromartie, vice president of Ethics and Public Policy Center, University of Tennessee Prof Wilfred M McClay, George Mason University Prof Hugh Helco, Center for Inquiry chairman Paul Kurtz and author Wendy Kaminer comment; drawing (M)","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Secular Society Gets Religion"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MCCLAY, WILFRED M"},{"name":"persons","value":"NEUHAUS, RICHARD JOHN"},{"name":"persons","value":"ELSHTAIN, JEAN BETHKE"},{"name":"persons","value":"KAMINER, WENDY"},{"name":"persons","value":"KURTZ, PAUL"},{"name":"persons","value":"NOVAK, MICHAEL"},{"name":"persons","value":"CROMARTIE, MICHAEL"},{"name":"persons","value":"HELCO, HUGH"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ETHICS AND PUBLIC POLICY CENTER"},{"name":"organizations","value":"UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO"},{"name":"organizations","value":"UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CENTER FOR INQUIRY"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"RELIGION AND CHURCHES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHURCH-STATE RELATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2002-08-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts & Ideas\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Felicia","middlename":"R.","lastname":"LEE","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By FELICIA R.

nation under God'' in the pledge of allegiance to wrangling over cloning, stem-cell research, euthanasia and genetic engineering, religion has been re-entering the public arena in complex and unforeseen ways. The flirtation between the secular and the sacred has traditionally set off alarm bells among American academics, who have often regarded any intrusion of religion into politics as dangerous. In the last century, intellectual giants like John Dewey and Sigmund Freud dismissed religion as infantile and predicted an increasingly secular modern society. In his book ''Human Nature and Conduct'' (Henry Holt, 1922), Dewey said of religion, ''It has been petrified into a slavery of thought and sentiment, as intolerant superiority on the part of the few and an intolerable burden on the part of the many.''","abstract":"Growing number of social scientists, philosophers, historians and other scholars are trying to account for energetic re-entry of religion into public sphere, and some are viewing it with much delight as distress; philosopher Michael Novak, Rev Richard John Neuhaus, University of Chicago Prof Jean Bethke Elshtain, Michael Cromartie, vice president of Ethics and Public Policy Center, University of Tennessee Prof Wilfred M McClay, George Mason University Prof Hugh Helco, Center for Inquiry chairman Paul Kurtz and author Wendy Kaminer comment; drawing (M)","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Secular Society Gets Religion"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MCCLAY, WILFRED M"},{"name":"persons","value":"NEUHAUS, RICHARD JOHN"},{"name":"persons","value":"ELSHTAIN, JEAN BETHKE"},{"name":"persons","value":"KAMINER, WENDY"},{"name":"persons","value":"KURTZ, PAUL"},{"name":"persons","value":"NOVAK, MICHAEL"},{"name":"persons","value":"CROMARTIE, MICHAEL"},{"name":"persons","value":"HELCO, HUGH"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ETHICS AND PUBLIC POLICY CENTER"},{"name":"organizations","value":"UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO"},{"name":"organizations","value":"UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CENTER FOR INQUIRY"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"RELIGION AND CHURCHES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHURCH-STATE RELATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2002-08-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts & Ideas\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Felicia","middlename":"R.","lastname":"LEE","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By FELICIA R.

The Hasidim claim that the right to practice their religion is compromised by female drivers transporting male students. Ample precedent supports the legal position that their claim is not automatically overridden by Federal law that prohibits discrimination on account of sex. This is also true even though the female drivers base their claim for certain bus runs on seniority provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.
