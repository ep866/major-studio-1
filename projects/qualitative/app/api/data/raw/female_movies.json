She died in on May 9, 2010, at the age of 92.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ms. Horne's voice was not particularly powerful, but it was extremely expressive. She reached her listeners emotionally by acting as well as singing the romantic standards like \"The Man I Love\" and \"Moon River\" that dominated her repertory. Ms. Horne might have become a major movie star, but she was born 50 years too early, and languished at MGM in the 1940s because of the color of her skin. She was stuffed into one \"all-star\" musical after another to sing a song or two that could easily be snipped from the movie when it played in the South, where the idea of an African-American performer in anything but a subservient role in a movie with an otherwise all-white cast was unthinkable.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The only time I ever said a word to another actor who was white was <a href=\"http:\/\/movies.nytimes.com\/person\/28405\/Kathryn-Grayson?inline=nyt-per\">Kathryn Grayson<\/a> in a little segment of 'Show Boat'&#160;\" included in \"Till the Clouds Roll By\" (1946), a movie about the life of <a title=\"More articles about Jerome Kern.\" href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/people\/k\/jerome_kern\/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Jerome Kern<\/a>, Ms. Horne said in an interview in 1990. In that sequence she played Julie, a mulatto forced to flee the showboat because she has married a white man.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 1947, when Ms. Horne herself married a white man - the prominent arranger, conductor and pianist Lennie Hayton, who was for many years both her musical director and MGM's - the marriage took place in France and was kept secret for three years.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"More\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\">Read More...<\/a><\/p>\r\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\r\n<p>In 1945 the critic and screenwriter Frank Nugent wrote in Liberty magazine that Ms. Horne was \"the nation's top Negro entertainer.\" In addition to her MGM salary of $1,000 a week, she was earning $1,500 for every radio appearance and $6,500 a week when she played nightclubs. She was also popular with servicemen, white and black, during World War II, appearing more than a dozen times on the Army radio program \"Command Performance.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Touring Army camps for the U.S.O., Ms. Horne was outspoken in her criticism of the way black soldiers were treated. \"So the U.S.O. got mad,\" she recalled. \"And they said, 'You're not going to be allowed to go anyplace anymore under our auspices.' So from then on I was labeled a bad little Red girl.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Ms. Horne later claimed that for this and other reasons, including her friendship with leftists like <a title=\"More articles about Paul Robeson\" href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/people\/r\/paul_robeson\/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Paul Robeson<\/a> and W.E.B. DuBois, she was blacklisted and \"unable to do films or television for the next seven years\" after her tenure with MGM ended in 1950.<\/p>\r\n<p>But according to James Gavin\u2019s Horne biography, \u201cStormy Weather,\u201d she did she appear frequently on \u201cYour Show of Shows\u201d and other television shows in the 1950s, and in fact \u201cfound more acceptance\u201d on television \u201cthan almost any other black performer.\u201d <\/p>\r\n<p>Although absent from the screen, she found success in nightclubs and on records. \"Lena Horne at the Waldorf-Astoria,\" recorded during a well-received eight-week run in 1957, reached the Top 10 and became the best-selling album by a female singer in RCA Victor's history.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the early 1960s Ms. Horne, always outspoken on the subject of civil rights, became increasingly active, participating in numerous marches and protests.<\/p>\r\n<p>Her last movie role was in 1978 where she played Glinda the Good Witch in \"The Wiz,\" the film version of the all-black Broadway musical based on \"The Wizard of Oz.\" But she never stopped singing. She continued to record prolifically well into the 1990s, for RCA and other labels, notably United Artists and Blue Note. And she conquered Broadway in 1981 with a one-woman show, \"Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music,\" which ran for 14 months and won both rave reviews and a <a title=\"More articles about the Tony Awards.\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/pages\/theater\/theaterspecial\/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">Tony Award<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Lena Calhoun Horne was born in Brooklyn on June 30, 1917. All four of her grandparents were industrious members of Brooklyn's black middle class. Her paternal grandparents, Edwin and Cora Horne, were early members of the <a title=\"More articles about National Association for the Advancement of  Colored People (NAACP)\" href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/organizations\/n\/national_association_for_the_advancement_of_colored_people\/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People<\/a>, and in October 1919, at the age of 2, Lena was the cover girl for the organization's monthly bulletin.<\/p>\r\n<p>By then the marriage of her parents, Edna and Teddy Horne, was in trouble. \"She was spoiled and badly educated and he was fickle,\" Ms. Horne's daughter, Gail Lumet Buckley, wrote in her family history, \"The Hornes.\" By 1920 Teddy had left his job with the New York Department of Labor and fled to Seattle, and Edna had fled to a life on the stage in Harlem. Ms. Horne was raised by her paternal grandparents until her mother took her back four years later.<\/p>\r\n<p>When she was 16, her mother abruptly pulled her out of school to audition for the dance chorus at the Cotton Club, the famous Harlem nightclub where the customers were white, the barely dressed dancers were light-skinned blacks, Duke Ellington was the star of the show and the proprietors were gangsters. A year after joining the Cotton Club chorus she made her Broadway debut, performing a voodoo dance in the short-lived show \"Dance With Your Gods\" in 1934.<\/p>\r\n<p>At 19, Ms. Horne married the first man she had ever dated, 28-year-old Louis Jones, and became a conventional middle-class Pittsburgh wife. Her daughter Gail was born in 1937 and a son, Teddy, in 1940. The marriage ended soon afterward. Ms. Horne kept Gail, but Mr. Jones refused to give up Teddy, although he did allow the boy long visits with his mother.<\/p>\r\n<p>She had been singing at the Manhattan nightclub Caf&#233; Society when the impresario Felix Young chose her to star at the Trocadero, a nightclub he was planning to open in Hollywood in the fall of 1941.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since blacks were not allowed to live in Hollywood, \"Felix Young, a white man, signed for the house as if he was going to rent it,\" Ms. Horne said. \"When the neighbors found out, <a title=\"More articles about Humphrey Bogart.\" href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/people\/b\/humphrey_bogart\/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Humphrey Bogart<\/a>, who lived right across the street from me, raised hell with them for passing around a petition to get rid of me.\" Bogart, she said, \"sent word over to the house that if anybody bothered me, please let him know.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Roger Edens, the composer and musical arranger who had been <a href=\"http:\/\/movies.nytimes.com\/person\/25962\/Judy-Garland?inline=nyt-per\">Judy Garland<\/a>'s chief protector at MGM, had heard the elegant Ms. Horne sing at Caf&#233; Society and also went to hear her at the Little Troc (the war had scaled Mr. Young's ambitions down to a small club with a gambling den on the second floor). He insisted that <a href=\"http:\/\/movies.nytimes.com\/person\/90483\/Arthur-Freed?inline=nyt-per\">Arthur Freed<\/a>, the producer of MGM's lavish musicals, listen to Ms. Horne sing. Then Freed insisted that Louis B. Mayer, who ran the studio, hear her, too. He did, and soon she had signed a seven-year contract with MGM.<\/p>\r\n<p>The N.A.A.C.P. celebrated that contract as a weapon in its war to get better movie roles for black performers. Her father weighed in, too. In a 1997 <a title=\"More articles about Public Broadcasting Service\" href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/organizations\/p\/public_broadcasting_service\/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">PBS<\/a> interview, she recalled: \"My father said, 'I can get a maid for my daughter. I don't want her in the movies playing maids.'&#160;\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Looking back at the age of 80, Ms. Horne said: \"My identity is very clear to me now. I am a black woman. I'm free. I no longer have to be a 'credit.' I don't have to be a symbol to anybody; I don't have to be a first to anybody. I don't have to be an imitation of a white woman that Hollywood sort of hoped I'd become. I'm me, and I'm like nobody else.\"<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"Hide\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more');
