If so, then the middle class - which falls into an income range of $15,100 to $25,200 in 1982 - has declined from 28.2 percent of the population in 1967 to 23.7 percent now.

The Administration has generally denied that there has been any increase in the concentration of income among households of the affluent. Mr. Reagan said the tax cut had been more beneficial to ''people at the lower end of the earning scale'' than to anyone else.
