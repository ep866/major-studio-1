The creation of the video, which argues that the State Senate offers the best hope of defeating the measure, suggests that abortion could emerge as a hot issue in the state elections this fall.

A few months later, every women's room at Harvard Law had a supply. Change is taking many forms these days at the nation's professional schools. Business students network at potluck dinners.
