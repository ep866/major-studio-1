That makes them part of a small but growing population that beat what the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ''disease'' of infertility. Lucky? Indisputably. First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a 41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention. Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the resulting embryos.
