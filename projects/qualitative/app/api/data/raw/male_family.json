When a novelist cuts back and forth between two stories, they should highlight and intensify each other. In ''Mandarin,'' Robert Elegant's novel of China in the late 19th century, the technique is botched.   The better part of the book is exciting, historically accurate, a good read. Mr. Elegant tells the true story of Yehenala, a young concubine of the Mandarin Emperor Hsien Feng. There is no need to embellish her story; the historical record is amazing enough. Of the hundreds of concubines and wives at the Imperial Court, Yehenala alone bore an heir to the Manchu Dynasty. This fact propelled her to a position of power in the treacherous world of the Emperor's court. The Manchu grip on power was ebbing. European adventurers were looting China as their forefathers had looted the Mexico of the Aztecs and the Mayans. Unable to defeat the Europeans in battle and incapable of developing an alternative strategy, such as playing the European powers against each other, the weak Chinese ruler vacilllated. It was a classical power vacuum, and Yehenala maneuvered to fill it. In the male-dominated, rigid class system of China, her opponents dismissed her. But by the time the great generals realized what was happening, Yehenala had ruthlessly consolidated power. She was to rule China for almost 30 years.   It is classic material, and Mr. Elegant handles it very well indeed. With such a story going for him, the mystery is why he has chosen to alternate Yehenala's tale with a second-rate family saga - a sort of ''Fiddler on the Pagoda'' whose plot hinges on the fact that a Jewish merchant and patriarch in China mistakenly believes the only sensible suitor for his daughter's hand is a gentile. This tale's denouement comes in a laughable scene in which the daughter's suitor eliminates in a few words the problem that has vexed the family for over 479 pages: ''You mean you didn't know, Fronah? I always assumed you knew. My mother was Jewish.'' ''Mandarin'' is seriously out of balance.  DELIVERANCE IN SHANGHAI    By Jerome Agel and Eugene Boe.  361 pp. New York: Dembner Books. $14.95.     By 1938, the United States and most of Europe had closed their doors to Jews fleeing Hitler's Germany, and the British were limiting the number of Jews allowed in Palestine. The one haven left was half the world away, the open city of Shanghai. A colony of merchant Sephardic Jews had lived there for almost a thousand years. Moreover, Shanghai harbored a wildly mixed population of Chinese, Japanese, Europeans and Americans.   But as Jerome Agel and Eugene Boe make clear in ''Deliverance in Shanghai,'' this open port was itself ultimately engulfed by the war. The Jews who had reached Shanghai at great peril found themselves forced into yet another ghetto, one created by the conquering Japanese.   This novel follows a group of refugees brought together on one of the last ships to leave Germany. The sea voyage turns out to be the high point in a story of unrelenting gloom. The urban, intellectual German Jews are not equipped to survive in street-smart Shanghai. Confused and docile, they allow the Japanese to herd them into a few walled-off city blocks. There they struggle to keep from starving before the Allies can win the war.   Perhaps because it is the one hopeful story told in this documentary novel, one roots for David and his young love Rebecca, who have been separated from each other by the Japanese. Just as the Allies are about to drive out the Japanese, these two manage to become reunited in the ghetto, only to face an even greater tragedy. ''Deliverance in Shanghai'' is a solidly researched, and unrelentingly depressing, novel.  J.O.  THE AUERBACH WILL    By Stephen Birmingham 430 pp. Boston: Little, Brown & Co. $16.95.   By  ELISABETH  JAKAB    Essie Auerbach, the super- wealthy heroine of Stephen Birmingham's ''The Auerbach Will,'' has lived long enough to see that most of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren have either ruined or are about to ruin their lives. Essie's life has been quite different. She moved away from her poor immigrant Jewish family on New York's Lower East Side by marrying an aimless young man from a middle- class, secularized, uptown Jewish family. She then proceeded to push him gently into one merchandising success after another. By the eve of World War I, Essie and Jake were hobnobbing with President and Mrs. Wilson, and no less an art dealer than Joseph Duveen is advising them on their collection.   As she recalls her busy and tumultuous past, Essie must also deal with upheavals of the present. Most of the latter concern the efforts of her oldest, four-times-married daughter to rally her siblings in an attempt to blackmail Essie into dividing up her fortune and art collection before she dies. Essie visits her lawyer forthwith to make sure that her will is legally unbreakable.   Mr. Birmingham is the author of nearly 20 fiction and nonfiction works concerned with the lives of the rich. While in ''The Auerbach Will'' he has conscientiously assembled enough dramatic material for a potentially interesting story, his results are lukewarm at best. The main problem has to do with Essie's descendants. It's difficult to summon up much sympathy for, or interest in, most of them: They are either vapid, silly and drunk all the time, or extraordinarily mean-spirited.   Essie, however, is a most appealing figure, especially in her early yearnings to escape the restrictions imposed by her rigid upbringing, as well as in her schoolgirl passion for the handsome young man who offers her a way out. She is also affecting when the love of her youth turns out not to be the love of her life.   Yet there's an overall feeling of clutter about this book, a result of our being given extensive dossiers on too many lives. This impedes the narrative flow and distances us from the story. Reading ''The Auerbach Will'' is a bit like going through a family picture album. The smiles in the faded snapshots shine across the years with a certain poignancy, but the experience remains only sporadically vivid.  CARETAKERS    By Tabitha King.  274 pp. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co.  $13.95.    By  JUDY  BASS    Joe Nevers, the hero of Tabitha King's second novel, ''Caretakers,'' finds it ''harder and harder to get a proper hold on the present.'' For him and his employer, Torie Christopher, the past encroaches so persistently that the present recedes.   Joe has lived all of his 73 years in Nodd's Ridge, Me., spending much of that time as the caretaker of summer homes. During the blizzard of Easter weekend, 1982, only one residence under Joe's supervision is occupied. That is the Christopher place, where Torie has come to stoke herself with liquor to forget that cancer infests her body.   When Joe arrives at Torie's home, she is already drunk and looking far more enfeebled than she should at 59. Tending to the house while the snowfall continues will be much easier for Joe than nudging Torie back to life. Tragedy made her a feisty, sour woman long ago, yet she has fascinated Joe for over 30 years, and he feels responsible for her welfare. Since Joe has neither a wife nor close friends, Torie represents his last brittle tether to the past. If she dies, ''he would be just another useless old man waiting to die, as good as dead.''   The storm keeps Joe and Torie together. Interspersed with the story of their struggle to survive are flashbacks recounting the youth, marriages and personal catastrophes of these tormented companions.  Their reminiscences are grim. Joe's first wife left him, and his second succumbed to disease. Both marriages were destroyed early by mutual hostility.   Torie's memories are equally bleak. Money and social position never insulated her from alcoholism, sickness, violence and the deaths of family members. Other disasters in her background that only Joe can explain nag Torie, and before the blizzard ends she discovers that while maintaining her home he has also rearranged the pattern of her life.   One flaw that detracts from the effectiveness of ''Caretakers'' is the random sequence of the flashbacks. Mrs. King follows a haphazard scheme, skipping from 1912 to 1956 to 1951 and so forth without any obvious plan. Despite this, the novel works well because the author communicates the quiet nobility of Joe and Torie as they attempt to understand the past. Although overridingly tragic, ''Caretakers'' yields glimpses of hope and courage.    Diana Cole is a writer in New York.

''Why would a girl want to play football?'' ''Girls will get injured because they're smaller and weaker than boys.''   ''If you let girls play on boys' teams, you'll have to let boys play on girls' teams and the boys will dominate the sport.''   These are the stereotypes embodied in the recently nullified New York State regulation that prohibited all girls in all public high schools in New York from trying out for all contact sports. Like most stereotypes, they are true for some people and not for others.   When the Westchester Chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union asked me to challenge this regulation in court, I was not aware of its existence. An avid football fan, I grew up in a football family, and later watched my son play in countless elementary, junior high and high school games. But the idea of girls playing football with boys had not occurred to me.   Consequently, when Jacqueline Lantz and her parents sought my help in fighting the barrier that prevented her from trying out for junior varsity football at Lincoln High School in Yonkers, I was forced to confront the stereotypes that I, and most other New Yorkers, had never had occasion to consider.   The first question was easy: why would a girl want to play football? The answer came quickly: for the same reasons that a boy wants to play. Football is fun and challenging; it develops teamwork, strength of character, competitive instincts and leadership qualities; it provides camaraderie with teammates and recognition and admiration from classmates; it helps with admission and scholarships to college; and, in some cases, it leads to a lucrative career in professional football.   Not surprisingly, these are rewards that appealed to Jacqueline Lantz, and convinced her that the long months of physical training and risk of injury associated with football were worth enduring. Her parents were supportive of her desire to be the best she could be, while never minimizing the risks of injury faced by all those who engage in contact sports.   A Hollywood casting director could not have sent me a more ideal plaintiff for a lawsuit challenging out-moded ideas about females in our society. Jacqueline is bright, athletic and articulate, with a gentle manner that hides an indomitable spirit. When she was first prevented from trying out for the junior varsity squad, she continued fighting because she ''just wanted to play football.'' But after a year and a half of being told that her only disqualification was being a girl, her desire to play fused with a determination to remove the state rule that predetermined that every girl is physically inferior to every boy.   Yonkers coaches and school officials, many of whom were sympathetic to Jacqueline's desire to play, were bound by the state rule, so it was necessary to sue the State Commissioner of Education and the Board of Regents, who are jointly responsible for enacting and enforcing rules governing the public schools, as well as the Yonkers School Board and the New York State Public High School Athletic Association.   We asked the U.S. District Court to strike down the regulation as unconstitutional because it denied girls equal treatment under the law, as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.   Laws that discriminate on the basis of sex are permitted under the Constitution only if they accomplish a valid governmental objective in a way reasonably calculated to further that interest. This law, we believed, neither furthered an important government interest or treated girls in a fair and reasonable way.   At trial the issues were sharply defined. The Government defendants offered expert testimony to prove a fact we readily conceded: the average girl is smaller, weaker and slower than the average boy. This disparity, they argued, makes the average girl more prone to injury than the average boy, and justifies prohibiting all girls, no matter how big, strong and fast, from qualifying to play football against boys. Safety, they said, is an important governmental objective that permits sex discrimination, and the regulation is reasonable because it prevents all girls from risking injury.   We argued that safety was not the only governmental objective in athletics. If it were, boys would not be permitted to play football, since there is a wide range in size, strength, speed, and consequent risk of injury among boys who play, as well. We pointed out that every court that has considered this issue has ruled that the Government cannot prohibit female competition in mixed football competition, because such participation fosters athletic opportunities for girls and redresses past discrimination against girls in sports. The most reasonable and safe way to accomplish these goals, the courts have said, is by considering girls as individuals, not as averages.   The Supreme Court has gradually struck down broad generalizations about females that do not hold true for all members of the sex. In these days when the Harlem Globetrotters have a woman player and a team of female climbers makes an assault on Mount Everest, it is hard to believe that in the recent past we have had laws to ''protect'' women because they were considered too delicate to practice law, work at night, tend bar, drive trucks, fight fires or engage in many other traditionally male activities.   The government also argued that permitting girls' participation on boys' teams would require reciprocal permission for boys to play on girls' teams. They feared that this could lead to dominance by boys and an actual decrease in girls' participation. This argument has been uniformly rejected by appellate courts around the country because past discrimination against females in sports justifies a prohibition of boys' playing on girls' teams - in order to promote equality of opportunity. The application of this concept of affirmative action to women is now firmly established by the Supreme Court.   In addition, the Government's argument that permitting girls to participate in contact sports with boys would decrease overall participation by girls in athletics was contradicted by the defendants' own witnesses. They testified that in the years since girls had been allowed to compete against boys in other sports such as baseball, tennis and soccer, the number of girls involved in athletics had increased dramatically.   After considering these arguments and facts, Judge Louis Stanton ruled that a safety regulation that prevents all girls, even those who could play safely, from trying out for football, while permitting all boys, even those who could not play safely, was too broad to be reasonably related to its objective. He found that it was unfair to prohibit those girls who were strong and fit enough to play, merely because the average girl was not as fit as the average boy.   Judge Stanton ordered that Jacqueline Lantz be given the same chance as her male teammates to display her abilities, and declared that the regulation that deprived her of her right to try out on an equal basis with boys was unconstitutional. In doing so, he ruled that Jacqueline Lantz, and every other girl in a New York State public high school, must be treated as an individual and not as an average.   Jacqueline's victory was not only a victory for high school girls. An additional benefit is that the publicity surrounding her suit has focused attention on the safety of high school football as presently regulated by the State Education Commission. The commission's experts testified to the inordinate risk of injury that accompanies football played by students of widely disparate weight, height and maturity, and the Government's evidence showed that this disparity is the greatest among boys. If this lawsuit causes the Regents and the commissioner to devise football safety regulations based on classifications by size (such as presently exist in boxing and wrestling) Jacqueline's victory will make football safer for all those who play.   Jacqueline is now on the junior varsity squad at Lincoln High School. Her coach says she's not in condition to engage in contact scrimmage and play, largely because she missed the first seven weeks of practice. But Jacqueline respects his right and duty to make that judgment. She's just happy to be there every day, and proud to be one of the team.

''That's what you get in South Jersey, when you get a divorce, you get charged with sex abuse,'' said Margaret E. Allen of Burlington City.   Miss Allen is the co-founder of the New Jersey chapter of VOCAL (Victims of Child Abuse Laws) and the fiancee of Christopher Clauss, who was arrested and charged with molesting his then 2 1\/2-year-old daughter on May 4, 1984. (The final divorce decree was granted May 14.) Mr. Clauss was later found not guilty in a Burlington County trial.   Miss Allen said that the charges against Mr. Clauss had stemmed from visitation difficulties with his former wife.   ''And you automatically lose your visitation rights,'' she said, ''and that's the way you lose custody, when you're charged with this.''   Miss Allen said that 90 percent of the 76 members of New Jersey VOCAL were involved in custody or visitation battles, had recently become involved with a new partner, or both. The chapter, formed in February 1985, was patterned after a group in Minnesota (there are reportedly 65 chapters in the country).   The New Jersey group is mostly male, but does include a few women accused of molestation and girlfriends and wives of men in the group. (Nearly all have been charged with abusing their own children, but some have been accused of molesting children they live with.) Miss Allen said that the state Department of Human Services' Division of Youth and Family Services, whose mandate is to protect children, did not follow proper procedure in investigations.   The division's actions, Mr. Clauss said, ''smack of Nazi Germany in 1933 and the McCarthy era.''   Geoffrey S. Perselay, the acting Human Services Commissioner, said of VOCAL: ''I'll quote from Shakespeare: 'Thou dost protest too much.' ''   ''There is a big difference,'' he said, ''between being 'not guilty' and being found 'not guilty' by a court, with the limitations on testimony. For example, the ability of a 2-year-old child, often your best witness, to express itself as to what occurred.''   ''It's frustrating as hell to sit here,'' he said, ''cloaked in confidentiality, being under court order not to disclose particular facts of a case, with no opportunity to defend ourselves. It's difficult enough to prosecute these cases and protect children, and then you have a group like this, trying to detract focus from the children.''   Senator Catherine A. Costa, Democrat of the Seventh District (parts of Burlington and Camden Counties), who has been meeting with members of VOCAL, said: ''It's a very serious situation. A lot of these people are really hurting bad. In some instances it's a means of gaining custody. It's a sad situation - extremely cruel. Full justice has to rise to the surface in cases of innocence.''   Elderly people, women with young children, the handicapped and the poor will have problems getting their food, nutrition, and health needs met when the Middlesex County Board of Social Services moves to the outskirts of New Brunswick from the downtown area, says Enrico De Gironimo, assistant coordinator of Community Outreach Program for Senior Adults, a Rutgers community mental-health agency, and a member of the central New Jersey Rainbow Coalition.   The coalition - comprising social workers, community activists and recipients of social services -has been protesting the move.   ''A lot of these people are walk-ins, or take the bus downtown,'' said Mr. De Gironimo, ''and it's part of the 'hidden agenda' of the New Brunswick gentrification effort to drive the poor out of sight.''   The lease on the social services building is held by Rutgers, which plans to take it over for its Mason Gross School of the Arts in June 1987; Rutgers, in turn, is being forced out of its present site for the school.   The recent decision to place the county's social services in a leased building on Route 27, bordering Franklin Township, was made by the county freeholders and the Board of Social Services. However, financing and decisions for the board are dictated by the freeholders, according to Mary L. Hollis, director of the Board of Social Services.   ''There will probably be some clients who will have some difficulty in getting there,'' Mrs. Hollis admitted. ''We have a considerable number of clients who walk in.''   According to Dorothy K. Power, deputy director of the Middlesex Board of Chosen Freeholders, ''there will be no hardship.''   ''It's a 3 1\/2-mile trip to the edge of town,'' she said, adding, ''We could have gone to Edison or Metuchen.''   Mrs. Power said the county was considering providing a small bus to pick up clients. ''Or they could mail things in, or call,'' she said. As for putting up a building in downtown New Brunswick, Mrs. Powers said, ''It would not be commercially feasible and there would be no parking spaces for the workers and the clients.''   Quentin Smith, a community consultant for the New Brunswick Outreach Center, a private nonprofit social-service agency, and spokesman for the coalition, said that the group was investigating the possibility of a class-action suit and would also use political and ''street'' tactics to deal with the issue.   ''Since they - the city and county policy makers - are making us, the poor and minority groups, uncomfortable - we'll have to make it difficult and uncomfortable for them, in terms of pickets and boycotts,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Additionally, we're planning a political response, when the coalition organizes its October convention, in terms of strategy for the 1986 election campaigns.''   Do you know the ''New Jersey connection'' for Lillian Moller Gilbreth, Carrie Bamberger Frank Fuld, Virginia Apgar, Ruth Cheney Streeter and Fanny Brice?   You can find the answers - and a lot more about many other women (53 in all) - in ''Eastern Her Story, 1986 Engagement Calendar,'' just off the press from Planned Parenthood of Northwest New Jersey, based in Morristown.   The 125-page book is filled with biographies of famous and not-so-famous contemporary and historical women in the Eastern states who have made contributions in the arts, sciences, government and other walks of life.   Decisions on whom to include were based on representation in geography, race, ethnic group, career, past and present figures, as well as proportions of well-known women and ''finds,'' as Jeff Brand, executive director of the Planned Parenthood affiliate, put it.   The calendars, which will be sold at $8.95 to raise funds, ''were a natural, in terms of celebrating contributions made by American women, and, at the same time, producing income for a women's health organization,'' Mr. Brand said.   For those who would like to get to know their ''finds'' a bit more, ample bibliographic material is provided.   ''We need to institutionalize our concern for the young,'' says State Senator Leanna Brown, Republican of Chatham.   Mrs. Brown, whose 26th District takes in parts of Morris and Passaic Counties, proposes to accomplish this by forming a new standing Senate committee on children. She plans to introduce a resolution calling for such a committee in the next legislative meeting.   ''When you have a standing legislative committee, you have hearings and linkages of how various programs can help,'' Mrs. Brown said, explaining that bills affecting children are now assigned to many committees and often get side-tracked in the bureaucratic maze.   For instance, she cited her own bills: One deals with discrimination against families with children in rental housing, the other creates an ombudsman for children. Both measures have not progressed.   A committee on children would be part of a three-pronged approach to children's issues, said Mrs. Brown. The proposed Governor's Commission on Youth and Families (recommended by an executive children's policy committee) would function as a recommender of policies; an ombudsman would follow the proposals through, at the executive level, and the legislative committee would implement legislation on children's issues.   A new standing committee can be created by resolution or by the more complicated change in rules, which would most likely not take place until the beginning of a new session"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd150258eb7c8105d630fa8","word_count":0,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/01\/28\/world\/asia\/japan-emperor-female-heirs.html","snippet":"As the governing party considers allowing Emperor Akihito to retire, many in the public believe the law should be permanently changed to admit women as heirs to the throne....","lead_paragraph":"As the governing party considers allowing Emperor Akihito to retire, many in the public believe the law should be permanently changed to admit women as heirs to the throne.","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2017\/01\/29\/world\/29EMPEROR\/29EMPEROR-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2017\/01\/29\/world\/29EMPEROR\/29EMPEROR-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2017\/01\/29\/world\/29EMPEROR\/29EMPEROR-articleLarge.jpg","height":425,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2017\/01\/29\/world\/29EMPEROR\/29EMPEROR-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"425"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2017\/01\/29\/world\/29EMPEROR\/29EMPEROR-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2017\/01\/29\/world\/29EMPEROR\/29EMPEROR-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Many Japanese Look for a Shift to Female Heirs to the Throne","print_headline":"Many in Japan Look for Shift to Allow Female Heirs"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Women and Girls"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Women's Rights"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Royal Families"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","name":"organizations","value":"Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","name":"persons","value":"Abe, Shinzo"},{"rank":"6","is_major":"N","name":"persons","value":"Akihito"},{"rank":"7","is_major":"N","name":"persons","value":"Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan"},{"rank":"8","is_major":"N","name":"persons","value":"Masako, Crown Princess of Japan"},{"rank":"9","is_major":"N","name":"glocations","value":"Japan"}],"pub_date":"2017-01-28T18:15:23+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Asia Pacific","byline":{"contributor":"Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Motoko","rank":1,"lastname":"RICH"}],"original":"By MOTOKO RICH"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"588cdfbf95d0e0392607d558","word_count":"1181","slideshow_credits":null}]},{"key_3":[{"web_url":"http:\/\/health.nytimes.com\/health\/guides\/disease\/congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia\/overview.html","snippet":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the name given to a group of inherited disorders of the adrenal gland....","lead_paragraph":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the name given to a group of inherited disorders of the adrenal gland.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"healthtopic","_id":"524493d038f0d8198973ca78","word_count":"623","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1990\/01\/28\/nyregion\/the-crash-of-flight-52-partial-list-of-those-who-died.html","snippet":"LEAD: Following is a list of victims of Avianca Flight 52 who have been identified by family members at the Nassau County or Suffolk County Medical Examiner's offices.
