Bobbe was born on May 16, 1916, in the hardscrabble mining town of Bisbee, AZ, and moved with her parents to Beverly Hills when Sunset Boulevard had yet to be fully paved. She was a successful business woman in the 1940s, when female entrepreneurs were a rare breed, and through the 1980s, as women increasingly rose to prominence in corporate America. She found great success in commercial and residential real estate as well in public relations. In the 1950s she handled Mark Taper's PR for his ambitious Lakewood development. With Coldwell Banker, Bobbe sold many of the more remarkable Los Angeles homes of her time, remarkable both for their lavishness and their residents. Bobbe was also an outdoors woman and athlete, fishing and riding horses. She skied and played tennis competitively, often against men. She raised and trained dogs and was a sports car enthusiast, well-known for the rainbow-painted Porsche in which she made her real estate rounds. Bobbe traveled widely throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. As a patron of the arts she greatly enjoyed classical music and in recent years, Lady Gaga. Her rapier wit and playful sense of humor was matched by her care and concern for others. Never one to talk about herself, Bobbe focused her incandescent personality on whomever she was with; her joyful presence absorbed as much as her quiet smile radiated. Bobbe leaves behind friends and classmates from Beverly Hills High School (1935, Class President), UC Berkeley and UCLA (1939, BA European History). She will be dearly missed by her family, including her niece Jeanne Meyers (Richard Carr) and nephews Charles Franklin (Susie) and Wayne Franklin (Susan); her grandnieces and nephews, Elissa (Clark Middleton) and Lucas Meyers (Margaret); Zachary Franklin (Sofia Zander), Seth Franklin (Kristin), Judd Franklin (Tybe Goldberg); and Jason Franklin, Barrett Franklin (Lea) and Shannon Hegarty (Terry); as well as by her great grandnieces and nephew, Ellington and August Meyers; Molly Franklin and Clara Zander; and Adena Franklin. Bobbe was predeceased by her younger brothers Benny (Ben Jr.) (same day as Bobbe, February 28, but 1973) and Maynard Franklin (2011). Beneficiaries of Babette's profoundly philanthropic nature include several health and educational institutes. She and her brother Maynard left the gem and mineral collection originally amassed by their parents, Ben and Clara, in Bisbee, to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, where it can now be seen by all. 1","abstract":null,"print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Memorials  FRANKENBERG, BABETTE MEYERS KNOWN TO HER FAMILY AND MANY FRIENDS AS \"BOBBE,\" DIED FEBRUARY 28 AT AGE 98, HAVING LIVED A RICHLY VARIEGATED AND ADVENTUROUS LIFE THAT CHANNELED HER PIONEERING SPIRIT AS A FEMINIST BEFORE HER TIME.

''Why would a girl want to play football?'' ''Girls will get injured because they're smaller and weaker than boys.''   ''If you let girls play on boys' teams, you'll have to let boys play on girls' teams and the boys will dominate the sport.''   These are the stereotypes embodied in the recently nullified New York State regulation that prohibited all girls in all public high schools in New York from trying out for all contact sports. Like most stereotypes, they are true for some people and not for others.   When the Westchester Chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union asked me to challenge this regulation in court, I was not aware of its existence. An avid football fan, I grew up in a football family, and later watched my son play in countless elementary, junior high and high school games. But the idea of girls playing football with boys had not occurred to me.   Consequently, when Jacqueline Lantz and her parents sought my help in fighting the barrier that prevented her from trying out for junior varsity football at Lincoln High School in Yonkers, I was forced to confront the stereotypes that I, and most other New Yorkers, had never had occasion to consider.   The first question was easy: why would a girl want to play football? The answer came quickly: for the same reasons that a boy wants to play. Football is fun and challenging; it develops teamwork, strength of character, competitive instincts and leadership qualities; it provides camaraderie with teammates and recognition and admiration from classmates; it helps with admission and scholarships to college; and, in some cases, it leads to a lucrative career in professional football.   Not surprisingly, these are rewards that appealed to Jacqueline Lantz, and convinced her that the long months of physical training and risk of injury associated with football were worth enduring. Her parents were supportive of her desire to be the best she could be, while never minimizing the risks of injury faced by all those who engage in contact sports.   A Hollywood casting director could not have sent me a more ideal plaintiff for a lawsuit challenging out-moded ideas about females in our society. Jacqueline is bright, athletic and articulate, with a gentle manner that hides an indomitable spirit. When she was first prevented from trying out for the junior varsity squad, she continued fighting because she ''just wanted to play football.'' But after a year and a half of being told that her only disqualification was being a girl, her desire to play fused with a determination to remove the state rule that predetermined that every girl is physically inferior to every boy.   Yonkers coaches and school officials, many of whom were sympathetic to Jacqueline's desire to play, were bound by the state rule, so it was necessary to sue the State Commissioner of Education and the Board of Regents, who are jointly responsible for enacting and enforcing rules governing the public schools, as well as the Yonkers School Board and the New York State Public High School Athletic Association.   We asked the U.S. District Court to strike down the regulation as unconstitutional because it denied girls equal treatment under the law, as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.   Laws that discriminate on the basis of sex are permitted under the Constitution only if they accomplish a valid governmental objective in a way reasonably calculated to further that interest. This law, we believed, neither furthered an important government interest or treated girls in a fair and reasonable way.   At trial the issues were sharply defined. The Government defendants offered expert testimony to prove a fact we readily conceded: the average girl is smaller, weaker and slower than the average boy. This disparity, they argued, makes the average girl more prone to injury than the average boy, and justifies prohibiting all girls, no matter how big, strong and fast, from qualifying to play football against boys. Safety, they said, is an important governmental objective that permits sex discrimination, and the regulation is reasonable because it prevents all girls from risking injury.   We argued that safety was not the only governmental objective in athletics. If it were, boys would not be permitted to play football, since there is a wide range in size, strength, speed, and consequent risk of injury among boys who play, as well. We pointed out that every court that has considered this issue has ruled that the Government cannot prohibit female competition in mixed football competition, because such participation fosters athletic opportunities for girls and redresses past discrimination against girls in sports. The most reasonable and safe way to accomplish these goals, the courts have said, is by considering girls as individuals, not as averages.   The Supreme Court has gradually struck down broad generalizations about females that do not hold true for all members of the sex. In these days when the Harlem Globetrotters have a woman player and a team of female climbers makes an assault on Mount Everest, it is hard to believe that in the recent past we have had laws to ''protect'' women because they were considered too delicate to practice law, work at night, tend bar, drive trucks, fight fires or engage in many other traditionally male activities.   The government also argued that permitting girls' participation on boys' teams would require reciprocal permission for boys to play on girls' teams. They feared that this could lead to dominance by boys and an actual decrease in girls' participation. This argument has been uniformly rejected by appellate courts around the country because past discrimination against females in sports justifies a prohibition of boys' playing on girls' teams - in order to promote equality of opportunity. The application of this concept of affirmative action to women is now firmly established by the Supreme Court.   In addition, the Government's argument that permitting girls to participate in contact sports with boys would decrease overall participation by girls in athletics was contradicted by the defendants' own witnesses. They testified that in the years since girls had been allowed to compete against boys in other sports such as baseball, tennis and soccer, the number of girls involved in athletics had increased dramatically.   After considering these arguments and facts, Judge Louis Stanton ruled that a safety regulation that prevents all girls, even those who could play safely, from trying out for football, while permitting all boys, even those who could not play safely, was too broad to be reasonably related to its objective. He found that it was unfair to prohibit those girls who were strong and fit enough to play, merely because the average girl was not as fit as the average boy.   Judge Stanton ordered that Jacqueline Lantz be given the same chance as her male teammates to display her abilities, and declared that the regulation that deprived her of her right to try out on an equal basis with boys was unconstitutional. In doing so, he ruled that Jacqueline Lantz, and every other girl in a New York State public high school, must be treated as an individual and not as an average.   Jacqueline's victory was not only a victory for high school girls. An additional benefit is that the publicity surrounding her suit has focused attention on the safety of high school football as presently regulated by the State Education Commission. The commission's experts testified to the inordinate risk of injury that accompanies football played by students of widely disparate weight, height and maturity, and the Government's evidence showed that this disparity is the greatest among boys. If this lawsuit causes the Regents and the commissioner to devise football safety regulations based on classifications by size (such as presently exist in boxing and wrestling) Jacqueline's victory will make football safer for all those who play.   Jacqueline is now on the junior varsity squad at Lincoln High School. Her coach says she's not in condition to engage in contact scrimmage and play, largely because she missed the first seven weeks of practice. But Jacqueline respects his right and duty to make that judgment. She's just happy to be there every day, and proud to be one of the team.

She now works with other senior managers to guide the integration of print and Web journalists and newsroom processes.<\/p>\n<p>Until April of 2007, Ms. Mifflin was the Executive Director of Television and Video for The Times, supervising all projects that involve The Times in television and Web video.  The department produces original video journalism for nytimes.com, the leading newspaper Web site and one of the most popular news and information Web sites in the world.<\/p>\n<p>She also supervised the production of television documentaries involving The Times, including several that won top broadcast journalism awards. After the launch of the Discovery Times Channel in March, 2003, her responsibilities included overseeing all content for that digital cable network, a joint venture of Discovery Communications, Inc., and The New York Times.  That joint venture ended in April, 2006.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"More\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\">Read More...<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n\n<p>From March 1995 until moving into The Times&#185;s television enterprises division in 1999, Ms. Mifflin covered television and other media news as a reporter for The Times. Previously, she created the Company&#185;s work-life services office, in the human resources department, serving as its director from March 1993 until March 1995. Before that, she served as an editor on the national desk and national education editor from 1990 to 1993, and as deputy sports editor from 1984 to 1990.  She began her career at the paper as a sports reporter in 1982.<\/p>\n<p>Before joining The Times, Ms. Mifflin worked for a year as an associate producer at ABC Sports, and from 1974 to 1981 was a reporter for The New York Daily News. She was that paper&#185;s first female sportswriter.<\/p>\n<p>Born in Philadelphia in 1951, Ms. Mifflin was a member of the first class of undergraduate women to be accepted by Yale University.  She graduated in 1973, with a degree in history. While there, she and a classmate organized the field hockey team, which in 1972 became one of Yale&#185;s first three varsity sports for women.  She went on to receive a master&#185;s degree in journalism from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1974.<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Mifflin was one of the first female sportswriters to work on a major metropolitan newspaper.  After two years as a city desk reporter for The News, she became a sportswriter there in 1976.  She has covered the major sports, as well as three Summer Olympics, the Lake Placid Winter Olympics, and, as a soccer specialist, two World Cup tournaments.<\/p>\n<p>In 2002, the PBS Nova documentary \"Bioterror,\" on which she served as co-executive producer, won an Emmy Award, The Times&#185;s first news and documentary Emmy. She was also co-executive producer on two PBS Frontline documentaries that won the Alfred I DuPont-Columbia University silver baton: \"A Dangerous Business\" (2004), which also won a George Foster Peabody Award, the Goldsmith Investigative Reporting Prize and, in combination with the articles in The Times, the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for public service; and \"The Secret History of the Credit Card\" (2005), which also won an Emmy.  Her department won a third duPont-Columbia silver baton in 2006, for \"Nuclear Jihad,\" a documentary co-produced by The Times, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Discovery Times.<\/p>\n\n<p

Many readers questioned why so much attention is paid to female athletes and argued that the fact that 57 percent of college students are now female is proof of discrimination against men by colleges and universities. Others asserted that Title IX overlooks the fact that men and women have different interests, and raised the question of whether fewer women want to play sports. Still others said the examples cited in the article showed that, 40 years after it was passed, Title IX needs to be rewritten.","abstract":"An article about Title IX and the roster management policies that universities use to balance their compliance numbers brought passionate responses from readers as well as a number of questions.

I strongly agree that female coaches are important role models for female athletes. The 60 coaches I interviewed often described the influence they have on their athletes' lives.
