Another volume in the series, THE SCIENCE TIMES BOOK OF ARCHAEOLOGY, examines such recent discoveries as the oldest human footprints, the Stone Age outfit of the Tyrolean Iceman and the prehistoric graves in Kazakhstan whose female occupants have characteristics remarkably like those attributed to Amazons by the ancient Greeks.
