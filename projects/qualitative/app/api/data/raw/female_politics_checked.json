President Reagan became clear in national polls last year, has emerged as a major factor in many 1982 election contests. Politicians report that what they call the gender gap is showing up widely in campaigns from coast to coast. Their campaign polls usually find Democrats getting more support from women while Republicans have more backing from men, but women vote in greater numbers than men. Facing this unaccustomed divergence, both parties are concentrating on women. Although they share some tactics, such as greater use of daytime television, the parties argue over whether the Reagan Administration's economic and budget policies have hit women hardest. Many Republicans are seeking to shield themselves from the effects of women's dislike for the Administration, shown repeatedly in national polls, by emphasizing education or the elderly in their campaigns.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"MALE-FEMALE SPLIT ON POLITICS FOUND A KEY FACTOR IN POLLS"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"PUBLIC OPINION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTION ISSUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1982-10-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"Front Page; U.S.; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Adam","rank":1,"lastname":"CLYMER"}],"original":"By ADAM CLYMER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd12a928eb7c8105d5f31d0","word_count":1355,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9A0CE2DD1439E533A25751C1A9609C94649FD7CF","snippet":"To the Editor of the Springfield (Mass.)

The Arab world? Forget it. Even in Israel, where tough-minded Golda Meir graced the Prime Minister's office, the \"four princes\" in Likud's successor generation have no place for a princess.    Ah, but what of the land of equal opportunity, where the U.S. Mint can't get rid of its Susan B. Anthony dollars? In closely watched Senate races in California, Illinois and Rhode Island, the women lost all three; one of the losing candidates, Representative Lynn Martin, has been appointed Labor Secretary.    The low percentage of women with real political power in the U.S. is an offense to democratic ticket-balancing. Two Senators out of a hundred; three Governors out of fifty; 6 percent of the seats in the House; and in cities with populations over 30,000, according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics, only one mayor in six is female.    If you're looking for a ray of light, that city showing is up from a pitiful 1 mayoralty in 25 cities 15 years ago, and a similar rise from a low base is reflected in state legislatures. Every Administration in Washington says it has appointed more women than ever before, and presumably political appointments encourage candidacies to elective office.    But progress is much too slow because women of every political stripe -- at home and around the world -- are letting down their own sexual side by not demanding more female candidates and by not supporting them when they run.    Granted, universal suffrage came to politics late; yes, women who are activists often turn off inactivists; sure, sex is not the main qualification for office. But now is now, women are voting -- and not enough are candidates and too few are winning. Why?    The power of incumbency is an excuse, as is the tug of tradition and the demands of rearing children. The reason, however, is a dismaying lack of assertiveness of group identity.    \"Vote as you shot\" rallied veterans; \"he's one of our own\" pulled out ethnic and minority support; \"no quotas\" attracts whites. All other things on issues being roughly equal, women should strongly support women as women until some parity is reached.

1940's the noted anthropologist Hortense   Powdermaker took her field work methods to   Hollywood. For months she observed the movie makers and listened to them talk about their work; then she wrote one of the flawed classics of American social criticism of the media, ''Hollywood: The Dream Factory.'' Later, in her autobiography, she candidly admitted her mistake: She had taken her Hollywood subjects as informants too literally. Accepting as truth their litany of complaints about venal moguls who crushed creativity, in her book she described the studio bosses almost as totalitarian dictators. Too late, she realized that griping was a means of self-justification and rationalization, the common coin of industry shop talk. Hollywood, she ruefully concluded, had put one over on her.   Nearly four decades later another social scientist, Todd Gitlin, who teaches sociology at the University of California at Berkeley, brings similar methods to con  Robert Sklar, a professor of cinema studies at New York University, has written books on motion pictures and television.  temporary Hollywood, the Hollywood of prime-time television production. Much has changed, though much remains the same, including the pitfalls. Now the Hollywood ''creative community'' generally speaks on the record, rather than anonymously. At the same time, media coverage of the media has grown so enormously that television producers, like football coaches, have learned to be performers themselves, repeating the same stories in the same words to one and all.   Most of these stories, as before, are filled with gripes. In this era the problem lies not with movie studio moguls, a vanished breed, but with network executives. The media creators are no longer employees of monopolistic studios, they are independent contractors supplying a controlled and concentrated market. Yet the conflicts and complaints remain strikingly the same: People who are making fairly large sums of money to create mass media products need scapegoats to assuage their own sense of bad faith, or the criticisms they perceive from the intellectual community - for example, from the inquiring sociologist.   Mr. Gitlin assesses his subjects' responses not only from an objective view as an observer, but also from the subjective perspective of his own politically committed stance. One part of his purpose is to compare the industry's rationalizations and justifications with his own leftist critique of television's role in American society. He avers that television programs are not just entertainment, they are ideology. He deplores the effects of advertising and the emphasis on consumption in mass media. He views with alarm a rightward shift in network television in the wake of the 1980 Reagan victory. He finds American commercial television mediocre as art and as social communication, and he doesn't know if television's flaws are the fault of American culture or the other way round.   And yet, confronting and confronted by the men and women who are responsible for what appears on television, the sociologist, like the anthropologist a generation ago, cannot help but be a little taken in. The hazard of the task is to identify with your sources. Mr. Gitlin finds the members of the ''creative community'' almost uniformly affable, genial, ingratiating. Face to face with them, he finds few villains and maybe even a hero or two, starting with Grant Tinker, the not so genial head of MTM Productions who went on to become top man at NBC. Ultimately, Mr. Gitlin is drawn deeply enough into the world of gripes and struggles to devote more than 50 almost breathless pages to the triumphs of his favorite show, ''Hill Street Blues.''   A dilemma for the media critic, whether left, right, or center, lies in the lure of getting ''inside.'' Going to the source promises to be the key that unlocks the whole system, but what it does is merely enmesh one in the problems and prospects of the source. Like the television programs Mr. Gitlin complains of, ''Inside Prime Time'' is most successful where it is most narrow and descriptive, focusing on the details of individual productions. Its theory of culture flounders precisely because of its too serious regard for television producers - making them metaphors for, or creators of, American culture itself.   Mr. Gitlin quickly rejects the notion, occasionally expressed both outside and inside the industry, that television's influence on American life is neither so pervasive nor so deep as the more extreme advocates or alarmists of the medium claim it is. He is in the position of other critics of the media, who have grown skillful in identifying the expression of ideology but who take on faith or theory what happens to that expression when it encounters a viewer. One would think it a truism that American culture is not the mirror image of American television, or vice versa. Of course American culture, American politics, American arts could be improved upon, as Mr. Gitlin wishes. To determine if television constrains that change, however, the media critic may need to look not inside the medium but outside, at the people who receive and use it.      A*FURTHER dilemma for the media critic is the problem of being taken in, not through face to face interviews, but through information gleaned from previously published books or articles. Ethan Mordden, author of numerous popular books on the performance arts, most recently the useful ''The Hollywood Musical,'' this time offers a tour through seven decades of American motion picture history mostly by re-telling anecdotes (real or invented) from the often ghost-written autobiographies of Hollywood's female stars.   ''Movie Star'' is a practical example of what Mr. Gitlin in ''Inside Prime Time'' calls the ''recombinant'' form (work that is made up of parts of other works), and it demonstrates that the form is not limited to television series. If Mr. Mordden is taken in by his sources, however, it must be remarked that he seems willing enough. His recombinant goal is to write, in movie-rating parlance, a PG version of Kenneth Anger's classic of risque movie star gossip, ''Hollywood Babylon.''   As in television programming, however, the titillation is accompanied by the avowal of serious purpose. Mr. Mordden periodically asks, What makes a star? What gives a star power? The answers include the usual suspects - luck, timing, type-casting, fulfilling a cultural need, perseverance, will power, gumption, even acting skills. Whether you get ''inside'' through interviews, as Mr. Gitlin did, or through stars' memoirs, as Mr. Mordden did, the secrets found - as Hortense Powdermaker belatedly discovered - turn out to be heavily affected by the motives of people coping with managing their careers. Often that involves having to be an actor in front of the interviewer's tape recorder"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd130ff8eb7c8105d5fe7c7","word_count":12,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/01\/17\/upshot\/republican-men-say-its-a-better-time-to-be-a-woman-than-a-man.html","snippet":"A survey shows 82 percent of women feel sexism is a problem today, while men underestimate the sexism felt by the women in their lives....","lead_paragraph":"A survey shows 82 percent of women feel sexism is a problem today, while men underestimate the sexism felt by the women in their lives.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2017\/01\/18\/business\/18up-women2\/18up-women2-thumbWide-v3.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2017\/01\/18\/business\/18up-women2\/18up-women2-thumbWide-v3.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2017\/01\/18\/business\/18up-women2\/18up-women2-articleLarge-v3.jpg","height":404,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2017\/01\/18\/business\/18up-women2\/18up-women2-articleLarge-v3.jpg","xlargeheight":"404"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2017\/01\/18\/business\/18up-women2\/18up-women2-thumbStandard-v3.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2017\/01\/18\/business\/18up-women2\/18up-women2-thumbStandard-v3.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Republican Men Say It\u2019s a Better Time to Be a Woman Than a Man","content_kicker":"Gender Inequality","kicker":"The Upshot","print_headline":"Sexes Differ on Persistence of Sexism"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Women and Girls"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Women's Rights"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Discrimination"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Gender"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Men and Boys"},{"rank":"6","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Sexual Harassment"}],"pub_date":"2017-01-17T15:58:19+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Upshot","section_name":"The Upshot","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Claire","middlename":"Cain","lastname":"MILLER","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"587e3f2395d0e0392607b257","word_count":"1351","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/10\/21\/us\/politics\/women-could-have-banner-year-in-2012-election.html","snippet":"More female incumbents than ever are up for re-election in the Senate, but if Democrats have a bad year, women could, too....","lead_paragraph":"More female incumbents than ever are up for re-election in the Senate, but if Democrats have a bad year, women could, too.","abstract":"Congressional elections of 2012 will have the largest number of female incumbents ever up for re-election in the Senate and would be among the highest number of female nominees ever;
