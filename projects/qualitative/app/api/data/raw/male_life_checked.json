When a novelist cuts back and forth between two stories, they should highlight and intensify each other. In ''Mandarin,'' Robert Elegant's novel of China in the late 19th century, the technique is botched.   The better part of the book is exciting, historically accurate, a good read. Mr. Elegant tells the true story of Yehenala, a young concubine of the Mandarin Emperor Hsien Feng. There is no need to embellish her story; the historical record is amazing enough. Of the hundreds of concubines and wives at the Imperial Court, Yehenala alone bore an heir to the Manchu Dynasty. This fact propelled her to a position of power in the treacherous world of the Emperor's court. The Manchu grip on power was ebbing. European adventurers were looting China as their forefathers had looted the Mexico of the Aztecs and the Mayans. Unable to defeat the Europeans in battle and incapable of developing an alternative strategy, such as playing the European powers against each other, the weak Chinese ruler vacilllated. It was a classical power vacuum, and Yehenala maneuvered to fill it. In the male-dominated, rigid class system of China, her opponents dismissed her. But by the time the great generals realized what was happening, Yehenala had ruthlessly consolidated power. She was to rule China for almost 30 years.   It is classic material, and Mr. Elegant handles it very well indeed. With such a story going for him, the mystery is why he has chosen to alternate Yehenala's tale with a second-rate family saga - a sort of ''Fiddler on the Pagoda'' whose plot hinges on the fact that a Jewish merchant and patriarch in China mistakenly believes the only sensible suitor for his daughter's hand is a gentile. This tale's denouement comes in a laughable scene in which the daughter's suitor eliminates in a few words the problem that has vexed the family for over 479 pages: ''You mean you didn't know, Fronah? I always assumed you knew. My mother was Jewish.'' ''Mandarin'' is seriously out of balance.  DELIVERANCE IN SHANGHAI    By Jerome Agel and Eugene Boe.  361 pp. New York: Dembner Books. $14.95.     By 1938, the United States and most of Europe had closed their doors to Jews fleeing Hitler's Germany, and the British were limiting the number of Jews allowed in Palestine. The one haven left was half the world away, the open city of Shanghai. A colony of merchant Sephardic Jews had lived there for almost a thousand years. Moreover, Shanghai harbored a wildly mixed population of Chinese, Japanese, Europeans and Americans.   But as Jerome Agel and Eugene Boe make clear in ''Deliverance in Shanghai,'' this open port was itself ultimately engulfed by the war. The Jews who had reached Shanghai at great peril found themselves forced into yet another ghetto, one created by the conquering Japanese.   This novel follows a group of refugees brought together on one of the last ships to leave Germany. The sea voyage turns out to be the high point in a story of unrelenting gloom. The urban, intellectual German Jews are not equipped to survive in street-smart Shanghai. Confused and docile, they allow the Japanese to herd them into a few walled-off city blocks. There they struggle to keep from starving before the Allies can win the war.   Perhaps because it is the one hopeful story told in this documentary novel, one roots for David and his young love Rebecca, who have been separated from each other by the Japanese. Just as the Allies are about to drive out the Japanese, these two manage to become reunited in the ghetto, only to face an even greater tragedy. ''Deliverance in Shanghai'' is a solidly researched, and unrelentingly depressing, novel.  J.O.  THE AUERBACH WILL    By Stephen Birmingham 430 pp. Boston: Little, Brown & Co. $16.95.   By  ELISABETH  JAKAB    Essie Auerbach, the super- wealthy heroine of Stephen Birmingham's ''The Auerbach Will,'' has lived long enough to see that most of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren have either ruined or are about to ruin their lives. Essie's life has been quite different. She moved away from her poor immigrant Jewish family on New York's Lower East Side by marrying an aimless young man from a middle- class, secularized, uptown Jewish family. She then proceeded to push him gently into one merchandising success after another. By the eve of World War I, Essie and Jake were hobnobbing with President and Mrs. Wilson, and no less an art dealer than Joseph Duveen is advising them on their collection.   As she recalls her busy and tumultuous past, Essie must also deal with upheavals of the present. Most of the latter concern the efforts of her oldest, four-times-married daughter to rally her siblings in an attempt to blackmail Essie into dividing up her fortune and art collection before she dies. Essie visits her lawyer forthwith to make sure that her will is legally unbreakable.   Mr. Birmingham is the author of nearly 20 fiction and nonfiction works concerned with the lives of the rich. While in ''The Auerbach Will'' he has conscientiously assembled enough dramatic material for a potentially interesting story, his results are lukewarm at best. The main problem has to do with Essie's descendants. It's difficult to summon up much sympathy for, or interest in, most of them: They are either vapid, silly and drunk all the time, or extraordinarily mean-spirited.   Essie, however, is a most appealing figure, especially in her early yearnings to escape the restrictions imposed by her rigid upbringing, as well as in her schoolgirl passion for the handsome young man who offers her a way out. She is also affecting when the love of her youth turns out not to be the love of her life.   Yet there's an overall feeling of clutter about this book, a result of our being given extensive dossiers on too many lives. This impedes the narrative flow and distances us from the story. Reading ''The Auerbach Will'' is a bit like going through a family picture album. The smiles in the faded snapshots shine across the years with a certain poignancy, but the experience remains only sporadically vivid.  CARETAKERS    By Tabitha King.  274 pp. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co.  $13.95.    By  JUDY  BASS    Joe Nevers, the hero of Tabitha King's second novel, ''Caretakers,'' finds it ''harder and harder to get a proper hold on the present.'' For him and his employer, Torie Christopher, the past encroaches so persistently that the present recedes.   Joe has lived all of his 73 years in Nodd's Ridge, Me., spending much of that time as the caretaker of summer homes. During the blizzard of Easter weekend, 1982, only one residence under Joe's supervision is occupied. That is the Christopher place, where Torie has come to stoke herself with liquor to forget that cancer infests her body.   When Joe arrives at Torie's home, she is already drunk and looking far more enfeebled than she should at 59. Tending to the house while the snowfall continues will be much easier for Joe than nudging Torie back to life. Tragedy made her a feisty, sour woman long ago, yet she has fascinated Joe for over 30 years, and he feels responsible for her welfare. Since Joe has neither a wife nor close friends, Torie represents his last brittle tether to the past. If she dies, ''he would be just another useless old man waiting to die, as good as dead.''   The storm keeps Joe and Torie together. Interspersed with the story of their struggle to survive are flashbacks recounting the youth, marriages and personal catastrophes of these tormented companions.  Their reminiscences are grim. Joe's first wife left him, and his second succumbed to disease. Both marriages were destroyed early by mutual hostility.   Torie's memories are equally bleak. Money and social position never insulated her from alcoholism, sickness, violence and the deaths of family members. Other disasters in her background that only Joe can explain nag Torie, and before the blizzard ends she discovers that while maintaining her home he has also rearranged the pattern of her life.   One flaw that detracts from the effectiveness of ''Caretakers'' is the random sequence of the flashbacks. Mrs. King follows a haphazard scheme, skipping from 1912 to 1956 to 1951 and so forth without any obvious plan. Despite this, the novel works well because the author communicates the quiet nobility of Joe and Torie as they attempt to understand the past. Although overridingly tragic, ''Caretakers'' yields glimpses of hope and courage.    Diana Cole is a writer in New York.

Graying usually begins at the temples and extends to the top of the scalp. Hair becomes progressively lighter, eventually turning white. Many people have some gray scalp hair by the time they are in their 40s. Body and facial hair also turn gray, but usually later than scalp hair.

By Brian Jackman.  Illustrated by Jonathan Scott.  224 pp. Boston: David R. Godine. $19.95; $24.95 after Dec. 31.     The watered grasslands of Kenya's Maasai Mara Game Reserve - in effect, the northern tip of Tanzania's Serengeti National Park - support giraffes, zebras, gazelles, wildebeest, elephants, black rhinos, water buffaloes and leopards. Above all, Mara is home to Africa's largest and finest population of lions.   Two British naturalists, Brian Jackman and Jonathan Scott, spent several years following a single pride with glances at the savanna's other wildlife. But for all its heaving, Mr. Jackman's prose never breaks free of cliche, though it concentrates tough-mindedly    Not to be confused with Jean- Claude Suar es' previous ''Illustrated Cat,'' ''Photographed Cat,'' ''Literary Cat,'' ''Preppy Cat,'' ''Great Cats'' or ''Cat Scrapbook,'' ''The Indispensable Cat'' pays another elegant tribute to what Anatole France called the only animal to have domesticated man.   There's not much natural history here, even if Mr. Suar es reminds us that cats have been part of human society for only half as long as dogs (5,000 versus 10,000 years). This is, however, the place to learn about such topics as cats in movies. Mack Sennett claimed to find the pioneer, a gate-crashing kitten named Pepper, ''as disarming as the lovely Lillian Gish.'' The poetry and prose included hew to traditional lines.   Among the artists, Edward Lear sketches himself as a fat stork stalked by his beloved, stump-tailed Foss; within his narrow range, George Herriman differentiates between lovesick Krazy and adored Mehitabel; and Fernando Botero paints a fat cat. One misses only an example of the schizophrenic English illustrator Louis Wain's electric-haired apparitions.  DOGS    By Rien Poortvliet.  Illustrated. Unpaged.  New York: Harry N. Abrams. $25.     ''Dogs'' proves a pleasant surprise after Rien Poortvliet's whimsical ''Gnomes'' and its sequels. Mr. Poortvliet sentimentalizes observable creatures too, but their postures and gazes are authentic. And even readers who deplore his aspirations to be a soft-focus Norman Rockwell (as in the many breed portraits in oil on textured canvas) should enjoy the fluent cartoons and earthy annotations of his sketchbook pages.   The current Poortvliet dogs - a pointer, a dachshund and two Jack Russell terriers - merit early and individual introductions. But the book's best story involves a runaway boxer, a windmill and a psychic. ''Cross my heart, not one word of it has been made up,'' the author assures us, but it reads like a collaboration between Alfred Hitchcock and Albert Payson Terhune.

The dean of American vertebrate paleontologists supplies a plodding text for illustrations that range from the pseudo-Bewickian to the proto-science-fictional. Readers willing to do some of the synthesis themselves should borrow their children's copies of ''The Illustrated Dinosaur Dictionary'' by Helen Roney Sattler (Lothrop, Lee & Shepard, $17.50) and ''A Field Guide to Dinosaurs'' by the Diagram Group (Avon, paper, $8.95), recommended last month in these pages.  WEIRD & WONDERFUL WILDLIFE    By Michael Marten, John May and Rosemary Taylor.  Illustrated. 224 pp.  San Francisco: Chronicle Books. Cloth, $27.50.  Paper, $14.95.     ''Weird & Wonderful Wildlife'' takes a loosely systematic look at some of nature's more striking evolutionary adaptations. While Michael Marten and his colleagues provide no separate text to speak of, their captions are long, specific and apparently accurate. One learns that the tentacles of a jellyfish called the arctic lion's mane can cover an area more than 500 yards square, that the platypus is one of the few poisonous mammals, that the 2-foot-long tongue of the giant anteater is worked by a muscle anchored to its breastbone.   The dramatic full-page color photographs range from the melancholy ruthlessness of the Philippine eagle (known as the monkey-eating eagle until President Ferdinand Marcos decreed a more dignified appellation) to the virtuosic sexual acrobatics of the great slug. Notwithstanding its carny- barker title, this is the season's best illustrated animal book.  THE GRAND DESIGN    Form and Colour in Animals.  By Sally Foy and Oxford Scientific Films.  Foreword by Gerald Durrell.  Illustrated. 238 pp.  Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. $24.95.     Why are some animals cylinders, others disks and still others logarithmic helixes?  ''The Grand Design'' marries textbook prose, not without its ration of curiosities - an eagle's bones account for only 7 percent of its weight, half as much as its feathers; the male silk moth is physically unable to eat - to largish, surprisingly effective blowups from Oxford Scientific Films. The pictures lose surprisingly little in being abstracted from the group's action sequences for public television's ''Life on Earth'' and other series.  WALKER'S MAMMALS OF THE WORLD    Fourth Edition.  By Ronald M. Nowak and John L. Paradiso.  Illustrated. 1,362 pp. In two volumes. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press. $65.     A classic is worthily revised. Ernest P. Walker (1891-1969), long the assistant director of the National Zoological Park in Washington, not only edited the first, 1964 edition of ''Mammals of the World'' but dedicated himself to obtaining clear black- and-white photographs of every new exhibit at the zoo. Now, after a 90 percent revision of the generic descriptions - the write-ups of what a layman might call ''different animals'' - we have a much expanded fourth edition. It is a model of reference-book making, with page numbers running consecutively through the two volumes and an index to the complete work in each one. Only the condensed table of habitats and the mutually contradictory endangerment classifications pose a bar to easy use. . The book's avocational (or obsessional) origins remain agreeably apparent in some of the photographs' pasted-on, typewritten labels.   ''Walker's Mammals of the World'' is comparable only to the more elaborate, expensive and anecdotal Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia (McGraw-Hill, 13 volumes). It provides up-to-date documentation for the professional and comments on the unique and superlative for the amateur. Of what animal can it be said that ''No other species has ever been as destructive to the habitat on which it depends for survival''? It makes a surprise appearance right after Gorilla gorilla in the ''Primates'' section"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1304d8eb7c8105d5fd142","word_count":170,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/01\/26\/nyregion\/mary-tyler-moore-pale-male-hawk-animal-rights.html","snippet":"Ms. Moore, who died Wednesday, may have been best known as a sitcom sweetheart and icon for career women.

Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Sandra","middlename":"Gardner","lastname":"SOME","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Sandra Gardner SOME parents who have been accused of molesting their children say they are victims of a new style of child-custody war - one in which vengeful former spouses charge them with sexually abusing their children as a way to eliminate visitation or gain sole custody.   ''That's what you get in South Jersey, when you get a divorce, you get charged with sex abuse,'' said Margaret E. Allen of Burlington City.   Miss Allen is the co-founder of the New Jersey chapter of VOCAL (Victims of Child Abuse Laws) and the fiancee of Christopher Clauss, who was arrested and charged with molesting his then 2 1\/2-year-old daughter on May 4, 1984. (The final divorce decree was granted May 14.) Mr. Clauss was later found not guilty in a Burlington County trial.   Miss Allen said that the charges against Mr. Clauss had stemmed from visitation difficulties with his former wife.   ''And you automatically lose your visitation rights,'' she said, ''and that's the way you lose custody, when you're charged with this.''   Miss Allen said that 90 percent of the 76 members of New Jersey VOCAL were involved in custody or visitation battles, had recently become involved with a new partner, or both. The chapter, formed in February 1985, was patterned after a group in Minnesota (there are reportedly 65 chapters in the country).   The New Jersey group is mostly male, but does include a few women accused of molestation and girlfriends and wives of men in the group. (Nearly all have been charged with abusing their own children, but some have been accused of molesting children they live with.) Miss Allen said that the state Department of Human Services' Division of Youth and Family Services, whose mandate is to protect children, did not follow proper procedure in investigations.   The division's actions, Mr. Clauss said, ''smack of Nazi Germany in 1933 and the McCarthy era.''   Geoffrey S. Perselay, the acting Human Services Commissioner, said of VOCAL: ''I'll quote from Shakespeare: 'Thou dost protest too much.' ''   ''There is a big difference,'' he said, ''between being 'not guilty' and being found 'not guilty' by a court, with the limitations on testimony. For example, the ability of a 2-year-old child, often your best witness, to express itself as to what occurred.''   ''It's frustrating as hell to sit here,'' he said, ''cloaked in confidentiality, being under court order not to disclose particular facts of a case, with no opportunity to defend ourselves. It's difficult enough to prosecute these cases and protect children, and then you have a group like this, trying to detract focus from the children.''   Senator Catherine A. Costa, Democrat of the Seventh District (parts of Burlington and Camden Counties), who has been meeting with members of VOCAL, said: ''It's a very serious situation. A lot of these people are really hurting bad. In some instances it's a means of gaining custody. It's a sad situation - extremely cruel. Full justice has to rise to the surface in cases of innocence.''   Elderly people, women with young children, the handicapped and the poor will have problems getting their food, nutrition, and health needs met when the Middlesex County Board of Social Services moves to the outskirts of New Brunswick from the downtown area, says Enrico De Gironimo, assistant coordinator of Community Outreach Program for Senior Adults, a Rutgers community mental-health agency, and a member of the central New Jersey Rainbow Coalition.   The coalition - comprising social workers, community activists and recipients of social services -has been protesting the move.   ''A lot of these people are walk-ins, or take the bus downtown,'' said Mr. De Gironimo, ''and it's part of the 'hidden agenda' of the New Brunswick gentrification effort to drive the poor out of sight.''   The lease on the social services building is held by Rutgers, which plans to take it over for its Mason Gross School of the Arts in June 1987; Rutgers, in turn, is being forced out of its present site for the school.   The recent decision to place the county's social services in a leased building on Route 27, bordering Franklin Township, was made by the county freeholders and the Board of Social Services. However, financing and decisions for the board are dictated by the freeholders, according to Mary L. Hollis, director of the Board of Social Services.   ''There will probably be some clients who will have some difficulty in getting there,'' Mrs. Hollis admitted. ''We have a considerable number of clients who walk in.''   According to Dorothy K. Power, deputy director of the Middlesex Board of Chosen Freeholders, ''there will be no hardship.''   ''It's a 3 1\/2-mile trip to the edge of town,'' she said, adding, ''We could have gone to Edison or Metuchen.''   Mrs. Power said the county was considering providing a small bus to pick up clients. ''Or they could mail things in, or call,'' she said. As for putting up a building in downtown New Brunswick, Mrs. Powers said, ''It would not be commercially feasible and there would be no parking spaces for the workers and the clients.''   Quentin Smith, a community consultant for the New Brunswick Outreach Center, a private nonprofit social-service agency, and spokesman for the coalition, said that the group was investigating the possibility of a class-action suit and would also use political and ''street'' tactics to deal with the issue.   ''Since they - the city and county policy makers - are making us, the poor and minority groups, uncomfortable - we'll have to make it difficult and uncomfortable for them, in terms of pickets and boycotts,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Additionally, we're planning a political response, when the coalition organizes its October convention, in terms of strategy for the 1986 election campaigns.''   Do you know the ''New Jersey connection'' for Lillian Moller Gilbreth, Carrie Bamberger Frank Fuld, Virginia Apgar, Ruth Cheney Streeter and Fanny Brice?   You can find the answers - and a lot more about many other women (53 in all) - in ''Eastern Her Story, 1986 Engagement Calendar,'' just off the press from Planned Parenthood of Northwest New Jersey, based in Morristown.   The 125-page book is filled with biographies of famous and not-so-famous contemporary and historical women in the Eastern states who have made contributions in the arts, sciences, government and other walks of life.   Decisions on whom to include were based on representation in geography, race, ethnic group, career, past and present figures, as well as proportions of well-known women and ''finds,'' as Jeff Brand, executive director of the Planned Parenthood affiliate, put it.   The calendars, which will be sold at $8.95 to raise funds, ''were a natural, in terms of celebrating contributions made by American women, and, at the same time, producing income for a women's health organization,'' Mr. Brand said.   For those who would like to get to know their ''finds'' a bit more, ample bibliographic material is provided.   ''We need to institutionalize our concern for the young,'' says State Senator Leanna Brown, Republican of Chatham.   Mrs. Brown, whose 26th District takes in parts of Morris and Passaic Counties, proposes to accomplish this by forming a new standing Senate committee on children. She plans to introduce a resolution calling for such a committee in the next legislative meeting.   ''When you have a standing legislative committee, you have hearings and linkages of how various programs can help,'' Mrs. Brown said, explaining that bills affecting children are now assigned to many committees and often get side-tracked in the bureaucratic maze.   For instance, she cited her own bills: One deals with discrimination against families with children in rental housing, the other creates an ombudsman for children. Both measures have not progressed.   A committee on children would be part of a three-pronged approach to children's issues, said Mrs. Brown. The proposed Governor's Commission on Youth and Families (recommended by an executive children's policy committee) would function as a recommender of policies; an ombudsman would follow the proposals through, at the executive level, and the legislative committee would implement legislation on children's issues.   A new standing committee can be created by resolution or by the more complicated change in rules, which would most likely not take place until the beginning of a new session"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd150258eb7c8105d630fa8","word_count":0,"slideshow_credits":null}]},{"key_5":[{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/23\/arts\/television\/patriot-amazon-tv-series-review.html","snippet":"A
