The Arab world? Forget it. Even in Israel, where tough-minded Golda Meir graced the Prime Minister's office, the \"four princes\" in Likud's successor generation have no place for a princess.    Ah, but what of the land of equal opportunity, where the U.S. Mint can't get rid of its Susan B. Anthony dollars? In closely watched Senate races in California, Illinois and Rhode Island, the women lost all three; one of the losing candidates, Representative Lynn Martin, has been appointed Labor Secretary.    The low percentage of women with real political power in the U.S. is an offense to democratic ticket-balancing. Two Senators out of a hundred; three Governors out of fifty; 6 percent of the seats in the House; and in cities with populations over 30,000, according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics, only one mayor in six is female.    If you're looking for a ray of light, that city showing is up from a pitiful 1 mayoralty in 25 cities 15 years ago, and a similar rise from a low base is reflected in state legislatures. Every Administration in Washington says it has appointed more women than ever before, and presumably political appointments encourage candidacies to elective office.    But progress is much too slow because women of every political stripe -- at home and around the world -- are letting down their own sexual side by not demanding more female candidates and by not supporting them when they run.    Granted, universal suffrage came to politics late; yes, women who are activists often turn off inactivists; sure, sex is not the main qualification for office. But now is now, women are voting -- and not enough are candidates and too few are winning. Why?    The power of incumbency is an excuse, as is the tug of tradition and the demands of rearing children. The reason, however, is a dismaying lack of assertiveness of group identity.    \"Vote as you shot\" rallied veterans; \"he's one of our own\" pulled out ethnic and minority support; \"no quotas\" attracts whites. All other things on issues being roughly equal, women should strongly support women as women until some parity is reached. Then, secure in a system in balance, they can throw the rascals out regardless of sex.   \"I used to look at the papers,\" says an 88-year-old Englishwoman of whom I have long been fond, \"and see Maggie right there, a splash of color in the middle of a bunch"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd1b4bf8eb7c8105d6d9d87","word_count":315,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9A0DEED7133EEE34BC4152DFB466838A669FDE","snippet":"ST.
