Maxis Communications, the organizer of the concert in Kuala Lumpur on Aug. 21, said she would not wear revealing costumes and would follow the local code of ethics for foreign performers, which bans the unnecessary baring of skin, The Associated Press reported. The National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students, with about 10,000 members, had protested the concert. ''Her performance and her attire are not suitable for our culture,'' Abdul Muntaqim, the organization's vice president, told The Associated Press. ''It promotes a certain degree of obscenity and will encourage youth to emulate the Western lifestyle. The concert should be stopped.'' A senior official at the Culture, Arts and Heritage Ministry said enforcement officers would monitor the performance. The official guide to performing in Malaysia says a female artist must be covered from the top of the chest to her knees. Jumping, shouting or throwing objects onstage or at the audience is not allowed. Performers' clothes may not carry obscene or drug-related images or messages.","abstract":"Arts, Briefly column; Gwen Stefani, despite protests by Muslim students, will go ahead with concert in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; photo (S)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Muslims In Malaysia Protest Stefani Concert","kicker":"ARTS, BRIEFLY"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"STEFANI, GWEN"},{"name":"persons","value":"VAN GELDER, LAWRENCE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"KUALA LUMPUR (MALAYSIA)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"ISLAM"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEMONSTRATIONS AND RIOTS"}],"pub_date":"2007-08-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Movies, Performing Arts\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"organization":"THE NEW YORK TIMES","original":"By THE NEW YORK TIMES","person":[]},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27efd8eb7c8105d848651","word_count":187,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/06\/09\/books\/review\/homeward-bound-and-bootstrapper.html","snippet":"Some mothers with means are re-embracing hearth and home, complete with a D.I.Y. twist....","lead_paragraph":"Some mothers with means are re-embracing hearth and home, complete with a D.I.Y. twist.","abstract":"Amanda Fortini reviews books Homeward Bound: Why Women Are Embracing the New Domesticity by Emily Matchar and Bootstrapper: From Broke to Badass on a Northern Michigan Farm by Mardi Jo Link.","print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2013\/06\/09\/books\/review\/0609-bks-FORTINI\/0609-bks-FORTINI-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2013\/06\/09\/books\/review\/0609-bks-FORTINI\/0609-bks-FORTINI-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2013\/06\/09\/books\/review\/0609-bks-FORTINI\/0609-bks-FORTINI-articleLarge.jpg","height":600,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2013\/06\/09\/books\/review\/0609-bks-FORTINI\/0609-bks-FORTINI-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"600"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2013\/06\/09\/books\/review\/0609-bks-FORTINI\/0609-bks-FORTINI-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2013\/06\/09\/books\/review\/0609-bks-FORTINI\/0609-bks-FORTINI-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"\u2018Homeward Bound\u2019 and \u2018Bootstrapper\u2019","main":"The Fortress of Solicitude","print_headline":"The Fortress of Solicitude"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","value":"Matchar, Emily","name":"persons"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","value":"Link, Mardi Jo","name":"persons"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"Y","value":"Books and Literature","name":"subject"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","value":"Women and Girls","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2013-06-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"BookReview","section_name":"Books","subsection_name":"Sunday Book Review","byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Amanda","rank":1,"lastname":"FORTINI"}],"original":"By AMANDA FORTINI"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"51b2019340e9ec65d203be4b","word_count":"1464","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/health.nytimes.com\/health\/guides\/disease\/urinary-tract-infection\/overview.html","snippet":"A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is an infection of the urinary tract.

You may leak urine from time to time. Or, you may not be able to hold any urine. The three main types of urinary incontinence are: Stress incontinence -- occurs during certain activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise. Urge incontinence -- involves a strong, sudden need to urinate. Then the bladder squeezes and you lose urine. You don't have enough time after you feel the need to urinate to get to the bathroom before you do urinate. Overflow incontinence -- occurs when the bladder cannot empty. This leads to dribbling. Mixed incontinence -- involves more than one type of urinary incontinence. Bowel incontinence is when you are unable to control the passage of stool. It is not covered in this article.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Urinary Incontinence"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"healthtopic","_id":"51fa8b7b38f0d8740ac89163","word_count":"11805","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/health.nytimes.com\/health\/guides\/disease\/schizophrenia\/overview.html","snippet":"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that makes it hard to: Tell the difference between what is real and not real Think clearly Have normal emotional responses Act normally in social situations...","lead_paragraph":"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that makes it hard to: Tell the difference between what is real and not real Think clearly Have normal emotional responses Act normally in social situations","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Schizophrenia"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"healthtopic","_id":"520cf52638f0d8740ac8bb6b","word_count":"8625","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/10\/12\/books\/single-girls-sex-but-still-no-respect.html","snippet":"Contemporary culture has never lacked for compelling images of the single woman.

They've run the gamut from glamorous to Gidget, from the original Cosmo girl to Carrie Bradshaw and company on ''Sex and the City.'' And while such thoroughly modern millies as the singleton Bridget Jones or the sex-addict Samantha are hardly real-life role models, they represent the idea of the single woman as a viable and even enticing entity, one that needs no more justification or documentation, say, than the domestic habits of the dedicated bachelor. But apparently this female demographic still requires a bookshelf all its own. It has been nearly 40 years since Betty Friedan attacked the conventional notion of the role of women in marriage in ''The Feminine Mystique,'' ushering in the first wave of feminism. According to the Census Bureau, single women over the age of 15 now represent 48 percent of the female population. But recently the literature seems to have regressed.","abstract":"Comment on lives and portrayals of single women in contemporary culture, as chronicled in new books Bachelor Girl: The Secret History of Single Women in the Twentieth Century, by Betty Israel, and Solitaire: The Intimate Lives of Single Women by Marian Botsford Fraser; problem may be that, in effort to validate lives of single women, the accomplished women who have written about them perpetuate image of their situation as plight rather than a perogative; photos of Gloria Steinem as Playboy bunny and Sarah Jessica Parker in television's Sex and the City (M)","print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Single Girls: Sex but Still No Respect"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"SEX AND THE CITY (TV PROGRAM)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"SOLITAIRE: THE INTIMATE LIVES OF SINGLE WOMEN (BOOK)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"BACHELOR GIRL (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"PARKER, SARAH JESSICA"},{"name":"persons","value":"STEINEM, GLORIA"},{"name":"persons","value":"ISRAEL, BETTY"},{"name":"persons","value":"FRASER, MARIAN BOTSFORD"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"LIFE STYLES"},{"name":"subject","value":"SEX"},{"name":"subject","value":"SINGLE PERSONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"}],"pub_date":"2002-10-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts & Ideas\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Phoebe","rank":1,"lastname":"HOBAN"}],"original":"By PHOEBE HOBAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd23bab8eb7c8105d7d0996","word_count":1585,"slideshow_credits":null}]},{"key_2":[{"web_url":"http:\/\/health.nytimes.com\/health\/guides\/specialtopic\/weight-management\/overview.html","snippet":"Weight management means keeping your body weight at a healthy level.

You may leak urine from time to time. Or, you may not be able to hold any urine. The three main types of urinary incontinence are: Stress incontinence -- occurs during certain activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise. Urge incontinence -- involves a strong, sudden need to urinate. Then the bladder squeezes and you lose urine. You don't have enough time after you feel the need to urinate to get to the bathroom before you do urinate. Overflow incontinence -- occurs when the bladder cannot empty. This leads to dribbling. Mixed incontinence -- involves more than one type of urinary incontinence. Bowel incontinence is when you are unable to control the passage of stool.

They've run the gamut from glamorous to Gidget, from the original Cosmo girl to Carrie Bradshaw and company on ''Sex and the City.'' And while such thoroughly modern millies as the singleton Bridget Jones or the sex-addict Samantha are hardly real-life role models, they represent the idea of the single woman as a viable and even enticing entity, one that needs no more justification or documentation, say, than the domestic habits of the dedicated bachelor. But apparently this female demographic still requires a bookshelf all its own. It has been nearly 40 years since Betty Friedan attacked the conventional notion of the role of women in marriage in ''The Feminine Mystique,'' ushering in the first wave of feminism. According to the Census Bureau, single women over the age of 15 now represent 48 percent of the female population. But recently the literature seems to have regressed.","abstract":"Comment on lives and portrayals of single women in contemporary culture, as chronicled in new books Bachelor Girl: The Secret History of Single Women in the Twentieth Century, by Betty Israel, and Solitaire: The Intimate Lives of Single Women by Marian Botsford Fraser; problem may be that, in effort to validate lives of single women, the accomplished women who have written about them perpetuate image of their situation as plight rather than a perogative; photos of Gloria Steinem as Playboy bunny and Sarah Jessica Parker in television's Sex and the City (M)","print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Single Girls: Sex but Still No Respect"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"SEX AND THE CITY (TV PROGRAM)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"SOLITAIRE: THE INTIMATE LIVES OF SINGLE WOMEN (BOOK)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"BACHELOR GIRL (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"PARKER, SARAH JESSICA"},{"name":"persons","value":"STEINEM, GLORIA"},{"name":"persons","value":"ISRAEL, BETTY"},{"name":"persons","value":"FRASER, MARIAN BOTSFORD"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"LIFE STYLES"},{"name":"subject","value":"SEX"},{"name":"subject","value":"SINGLE PERSONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"}],"pub_date":"2002-10-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts & Ideas\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Phoebe","rank":1,"lastname":"HOBAN"}],"original":"By PHOEBE HOBAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd23bab8eb7c8105d7d0996","word_count":1585,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/04\/26\/books\/review\/Bellafante-t.html","snippet":"A biography calls Helen Gurley Brown a trailblazing feminist....","lead_paragraph":"A biography calls Helen Gurley Brown a trailblazing feminist.","abstract":null,"print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"thumbnail","url":"images\/2009\/04\/26\/books\/bellafante-75.jpg","height":75,"width":75,"legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2009\/04\/26\/books\/bellafante-75.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"Book Review | 'Bad Girls Go Everywhere: The Life of Helen Gurley Brown,' by Jennifer Scanlon","main":"Miniskirt Lib","print_headline":"Miniskirt Lib"},"keywords":[{"value":"Books and Literature","is_major":"N","rank":"1","name":"subject"},{"value":"Brown, Helen Gurley","is_major":"N","rank":"2","name":"persons"},{"value":"Women","is_major":"N","rank":"3","name":"subject"},{"value":"Feminist Movement","is_major":"N","rank":"4","name":"subject"},{"value":"Cosmopolitan","is_major":"N","rank":"5","name":"organizations"},{"value":"Friedan, Betty","is_major":"N","rank":"6","name":"persons"}],"pub_date":"2009-04-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"BookReview","section_name":"Books","subsection_name":"Sunday Book Review","byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ginia","lastname":"BELLAFANTE"}],"original":"By GINIA BELLAFANTE"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"546989e138f0d8317bec13b1","word_count":"655","slideshow_credits":null}]},{"key_4":[{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2008\/05\/16\/the-post-materialist-japanese-food-porn\/","snippet":"A report from our Berlin correspondent on design in culture.

The music and the lifestyle intertwined with it were designed to rip apart routines, in the rock scene and in the larger culture. But punk's bomb has gone off intermittently for over two decades, and its adherents stay alive within the rubble. They form a society of outcasts, the teenagers (and, eventually, adults) who don't conform to standards of beauty, power and propriety, and support each other as they fight to stay true to themselves. This year's quintessential Warped tour attendee was a girl in a leopard-skin dog collar, blue-streaked hair, a worn T-shirt and droopy fatigues, with ''Dork'' written in felt pen across her backpack between the badges advertising bands from the Sex Pistols to Green Day. Such teen angels of Warped, male and female, looked shy and diffident despite their sartorial boldness as they eyed potential dates, shared fried dough and cigarettes and sought out their high school cliques.","abstract":"Ann Powers reviews punk rock performances in Vans Warped Tour concert, on Randalls Island; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Music as Background at a Pleasant Party","kicker":"POP REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"VANS WARPED TOUR (MUSIC EVENT)"}],"pub_date":"2000-07-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Ann","rank":1,"lastname":"POWERS"}],"original":"By ANN POWERS"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1fa5d8eb7c8105d75822a","word_count":836,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/03\/06\/opinion\/06dowd.html","snippet":"Americans like to see women who wear the pants be beaten up and humiliated....","lead_paragraph":"Arabs put their women in veils.

The music and the lifestyle intertwined with it were designed to rip apart routines, in the rock scene and in the larger culture. But punk's bomb has gone off intermittently for over two decades, and its adherents stay alive within the rubble. They form a society of outcasts, the teenagers (and, eventually, adults) who don't conform to standards of beauty, power and propriety, and support each other as they fight to stay true to themselves. This year's quintessential Warped tour attendee was a girl in a leopard-skin dog collar, blue-streaked hair, a worn T-shirt and droopy fatigues, with ''Dork'' written in felt pen across her backpack between the badges advertising bands from the Sex Pistols to Green Day. Such teen angels of Warped, male and female, looked shy and diffident despite their sartorial boldness as they eyed potential dates, shared fried dough and cigarettes and sought out their high school cliques.","abstract":"Ann Powers reviews punk rock performances in Vans Warped Tour concert, on Randalls Island;
