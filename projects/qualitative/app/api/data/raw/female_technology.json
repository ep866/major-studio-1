But the technique will not work for pork farmers, because pig sperm does not stand freezing, and artificial insemination is of limited use with horses, because horse sperm can be refrigerated only briefly. But now a Gulph Mills, Pa., company that specializes in commercializing biotechnology patents is working on a method of preserving sperm that requires no refrigeration. The company, British Technology Group USA, uses a polymer gel to encapsulate the sperm. At room temperature, the polymer solidifies, immobilizing the sperm and lowering their metabolic activity. The polymer is permeable, letting oxygen in and waste products out. Because it is encapsulated in the polymer, the sperm can be sent through the mail.

''Take Back the Decks: An Evening of Women in Underground Music'' presented female D.J.'s and rappers to a female-dominated audience that recalled Lilith Fair. On one important level this evening did Lilith one better. Male backing musicians outnumbered the female stars at that much-admired festival. ''Take Back the Decks'' featured pure female artistry. Technology, that old reliable liberator, made the leap possible. Machine-generated hip-hop and dance music can be created by a D.J. or turntablist alone, or in league with a vocalist. Instead of casting around for a female drummer, bassist and guitarist, an aspiring rapper can simply partner with a female turntablist. Or that turntablist can create a show all by herself.","abstract":"Ann Powers reviews program of women in underground music, including DJ's and rappers, at Lighthouse Frying Pan; photo (M)","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Lessons for the Sisterhood In Turntable Wizardry","kicker":"POP REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"2000-05-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Ann","rank":1,"lastname":"POWERS"}],"original":"By ANN POWERS"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd23d4a8eb7c8105d7d3061","word_count":445,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/14\/t-magazine\/art\/anicka-yi.html","snippet":"She has used tempura-fried flowers, incorporated smell, and injected live snails with oxytocin....","lead_paragraph":"She has used tempura-fried flowers, incorporated smell, and injected live snails with oxytocin.","abstract":null,"print_page":163,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":75,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/14\/t-magazine\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8-thumbStandard.jpg","rank":0,"height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2017\/02\/14\/t-magazine\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":75},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/14\/t-magazine\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8-articleLarge.jpg","rank":0,"height":383,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"xlarge":"images\/2017\/02\/14\/t-magazine\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":383},"type":"image"},{"width":190,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/14\/t-magazine\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8-thumbWide.jpg","rank":0,"height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2017\/02\/14\/t-magazine\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8\/anicka-yi-slide-1NR8-thumbWide.jpg","widewidth":190,"wideheight":126},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Anicka Yi Is Inventing a New Kind of Conceptual Art","kicker":"","print_headline":"Burn After Reading","content_kicker":""},"keywords":[{"isMajor":"N","rank":1,"name":"subject","value":"Art"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":2,"name":"persons","value":"Yi, Anicka"}],"pub_date":"2017-02-14T16:02:12+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"TStyle","section_name":"T Magazine","subsection_name":"Art","byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Alice","lastname":"GREGORY"}],"original":"By ALICE GREGORY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"58a32a0c95d0e02474636616","word_count":1644,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/bits.blogs.nytimes.com\/2015\/12\/11\/daily-report-machines-outdo-humans-in-identifying-characters\/","snippet":"A so-called computer-vision program was able to outperform humans in identifying handwritten characters.

Less talked about is another ''digital divide,'' the fact that fewer women are entering today's booming technology fields. Studies show that women are active users of the new technology and that female Internet users slightly outnumber male users. But the paucity of women creating that technology is cause for concern. The most recent National Science Foundation statistics show that between 1984 and 1997, the proportion of women receiving bachelor's degrees in computer science dropped from 37 percent to 27 percent. Currently, women make up only 20 percent of the information technology work force.","abstract":"Editorial laments fact that fewer women are entering booming technology fields; says technology industry badly needs more workers and that women represent major untapped source of talent that could solve shortage (S)","print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Technology's Gender Gap"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"LABOR"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHORTAGES"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}],"pub_date":"2000-09-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd209798eb7c8105d7754d4","word_count":325,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/07\/03\/health\/more-women-seek-over-the-counter-sexual-remedies.html","snippet":"Female sexual dysfunction remains a controversial topic, even as it becomes an official diagnosis and companies have begun creating more products to address it....","lead_paragraph":"Female sexual dysfunction remains a controversial topic, even as it becomes an official diagnosis and companies have begun creating more products to address it.","abstract":"More women are turning to over-the-counter products to increase sexual arousal and pleasure, and companies are responding by creating more products for them; some express concern that commercial efforts to address female sexual dysfunction, which remains difficult to define, may pressure women to see a problem where one does not exist.","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":75,"url":"images\/2012\/07\/03\/science\/03WOME\/03WOME-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2012\/07\/03\/science\/03WOME\/03WOME-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"More Women Seek Over-the-Counter Sexual Remedies","main":"More Women Look Over the Counter for a Libido Fix","print_headline":"More Women Look Over the Counter for a Libido Fix"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","value":"Women and Girls","name":"subject"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","value":"Sex","name":"subject"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"Y","value":"Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2012-07-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Science","section_name":"Health","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Abby","rank":1,"lastname":"ELLIN"}],"original":"By ABBY ELLIN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"51c216fd7e0d9c0839d2a2fd","word_count":"1186","slideshow_credits":null}]},{"key_8":null},{"key_9":{"message":"API rate limit exceeded"}}]
