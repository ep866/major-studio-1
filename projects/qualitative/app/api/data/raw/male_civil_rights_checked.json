This disagreement underlies radically different approaches to important civil rights issues, in particular the Administration's opposition to hiring quotas based on race and sex to overcome job discrimination and mandatory busing to end school segregation. The Administration's positions on these issues reflect its rejection of a principle embodied in many Federal court decisions: that special preferences for blacks and other disadvantaged groups, and special ''race-conscious'' efforts to integrate schools, are necessary in some cases to avoid perpetuating the effects of past discrimination. William Bradford Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, justified the Administration's opposition to such race-conscious civil rights policies in a recent speech by invoking ''the color-blind ideal of equal opportunity for all.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"News Analysis","kicker":"'COLOR-BLIND' RIGHTS LAW"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"BLACKS (IN US)"},{"name":"subject","value":"DISCRIMINATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"MINORITIES (ETHNIC, RACIAL, RELIGIOUS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONSTITUTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1982-03-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.;

At the same time, the Court made it more difficult to seek some rights in the Federal courts. It placed new barriers in the path of prisoners seeking to challenge their convictions in Federal court and giving government officials new protection against suits by citizens whose rights they may have violated. Many of the Court's most important rulings this year seemed more the product of fragile and shifting coalitions among the Justices than of any overriding vision of the law or the Constitution. Among the numerous 5-to-4 decisions were those holding that the President of the United States is absolutely immune from civil suit for illegal or unconstitutional acts taken in his term, that illegal alien children are entitled to a free public education, that male students may not be barred from a state-operated school of nursing and that the Constitution limits the discretion of school boards to remove books from library shelves.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"News Analysis","kicker":"SUPREME COURT TERM: DIVISIONS OVER RIGHTS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"SUPREME COURT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ILLEGAL ALIENS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRISONS AND PRISONERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CENSORSHIP"},{"name":"subject","value":"MENTAL RETARDATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS"},{"name":"subject","value":"DECISIONS AND VERDICTS"}],"pub_date":"1982-07-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"Front Page; Education; U.S.; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Linda","rank":1,"lastname":"GREENHOUSE"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"An Analysis","_id":"4fd125928eb7c8105d5ebaf7","word_count":2357,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/05\/16\/opinion\/16rich.html","snippet":"A new same-sex religious right scandal for an old culture war....","lead_paragraph":"A new same-sex religious right scandal for an old culture war.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2010\/05\/16\/opinion\/16rich_art\/16rich_art-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2010\/05\/16\/opinion\/16rich_art\/16rich_art-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2010\/05\/15\/opinion\/rich_190scoop\/rich_190scoop-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2010\/05\/15\/opinion\/rich_190scoop\/rich_190scoop-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"A Heaven-Sent Rent Boy","content_kicker":"Op-Ed Columnist","print_headline":"A Heaven-Sent Rent Boy"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Homosexuality"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Civil Rights and Liberties"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","name":"organizations","value":"Supreme Court"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","name":"persons","value":"Kagan, Elena"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","name":"organizations","value":"Family Research Council"}],"pub_date":"2010-05-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Frank","rank":1,"lastname":"RICH"}],"original":"By FRANK RICH"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"54463ea038f0d832c813fdf3","word_count":"1551","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9C00EFDF1031E432A25756C2A9649C946890D6CF","snippet":"ONE of the more striking historical parallels in American politics has to do with the similarity of the origins of the feminist movements of the  19th and 20th centuries: the former in the struggle for the abolition of slavery, the latter in the c...","lead_paragraph":"ONE of the more striking historical parallels in American politics has to do with the similarity of the origins of the feminist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries: the former in the struggle for the abolition of slavery, the latter in the civil-rights movement and the New Left.","abstract":"Evans, Sara: Personal Politics.

Civil rights groups have complained that the new committees, which monitor and report on developments in their states, will be more conservative than the old committees and more likely to abandon their role as advocates for racial minorities and women. But a White House official said that many of the new appointees are prominent in the field of civil rights and that such fears are unfounded. Under Federal law, the advisory committees are rechartered every two years, which allows the White House to change the number and composition of their members. According to statistics released this week by commission officials, there are 313 new appointees among the more than 500 members of the new advisory panels. Men head 46 of the panels and women head 4, as against 31 men and 20 women as chairmen of the old panels.

ASBO is an acronym for the ''anti-social behavior orders'' that have been introduced by the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair. He has promised to extend them in the third term he won in elections earlier this month. An ASBO is a kind of esoteric injunction that bans people from highly specific acts that fall just this side of criminality.

The New Jersey Division of Civil Rights ruled this week that the clubs' ties to the university render them public accommodations and therefore subject to the same law concerning discrimination as the university. The decision came in a five-year-old complaint by Sally Frank, a 1980 Princeton graduate whose requests to join the eating clubs were rejected in 1979. The decision, which established state jurisdiction over the clubs, is not binding, but will probably result in an order by the division for the clubs to consider women for admission, according to the participants. Such an order could be appealed to the courts, however.","abstract":null,"print_page":"38","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"COURT FIGHT SEEN ON PRINCETON
