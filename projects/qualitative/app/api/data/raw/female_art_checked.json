This idea may cross the mind more than once during ''Art\/Fashion,'' a sometimes wonderful, spiffily turned-out exhibition of art-related fashion and fashion-related art at the Guggenheim Museum SoHo. The notion registers in the show's first gallery, where a bright, dynamic vest designed by the Futurist Giacomo Balla may strike some as more appealing, in a Paul Smith sort of way, than his paintings. It pops up again in a gallery dominated by the boldly geometric clothing and designs of the painter Sonia Delaunay. It is stunning to see Delaunay transpose the ideas of modernist abstraction onto women's backs; a similar translation occurs in the emblematic, paper-doll-like fashion drawings of the Russian Constructivist Varvara Stepanova.","abstract":"Roberta Smith reviews Art\/Fashion, exhibition of art-related fashion and fashion-related art at the Guggenheim Museum SoHo; photo (M)","print_page":"28","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Serious Side of an Infatuation With Fashion","kicker":"ART REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM SOHO"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"1997-03-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Roberta","rank":1,"lastname":"SMITH"}],"original":"By ROBERTA SMITH"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd20ee08eb7c8105d780b09","word_count":880,"slideshow_credits":null}]}]
