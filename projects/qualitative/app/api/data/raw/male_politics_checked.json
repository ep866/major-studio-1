Politicians report that what they call the gender gap is showing up widely in campaigns from coast to coast. Their campaign polls usually find Democrats getting more support from women while Republicans have more backing from men, but women vote in greater numbers than men. Facing this unaccustomed divergence, both parties are concentrating on women. Although they share some tactics, such as greater use of daytime television, the parties argue over whether the Reagan Administration's economic and budget policies have hit women hardest. Many Republicans are seeking to shield themselves from the effects of women's dislike for the Administration, shown repeatedly in national polls, by emphasizing education or the elderly in their campaigns.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"MALE-FEMALE SPLIT ON POLITICS FOUND A KEY FACTOR IN POLLS"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"PUBLIC OPINION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTION ISSUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1982-10-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"Front Page; U.S.; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Adam","rank":1,"lastname":"CLYMER"}],"original":"By ADAM CLYMER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd12a928eb7c8105d5f31d0","word_count":1355,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9507EFDF1E3CE03ABC4153DFB767838F659EDE","snippet":"Here is one woman who has definitely decided to prepare herself for taking a part in politics or, preferably government, since the mud-slinging and currying of favor that are ramps in political campaigns disgust me....","lead_paragraph":"Here is one woman who has definitely decided to prepare herself for taking a part in politics or, preferably government, since the mud-slinging and currying of favor that are ramps in political campaigns disgust me.","abstract":"Lr on women's pol role","print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Woman Sounds a Warning; Objects to Male Conduct of Politics and Intends to Take a Hand"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CHATFIELD, ISABEL"}],"pub_date":"1944-11-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Isabel","lastname":"CHATFIELD"}],"original":"ISABEL CHATFIELD"},"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fc22f6645c1498b0d65e0dc","word_count":421,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9401E1DB163FE633A25751C1A9679C946296D6CF","snippet":"Declaring that to be a male school teacher was \"the crowning misfortune of the present dispensation,\" some 400 male school teachers decided at a dinner held in Kalil's restaurant last night to fight for economic survival through direct political a...","lead_paragraph":"Declaring that to be a male school teacher was \"the crowning misfortune of the present dispensation,\" some 400 male school teachers decided at a dinner held in Kalil's restaurant last night to fight for economic survival through direct political action.","abstract":"Men teachers form an association","print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"MALE TEACHERS SEE OPENING IN POLITICS; With an Estimated Control of 20,000 Votes, They Propose to \"Fight for Rights.\""},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ASSOCIATION OF MEN TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BOARD OF EDUCATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ALVORD COMPANIES, N.

For decades Western businessmen have relished the sexual ''entertainments'' provided by their hosts, ascribing these privileges to ''Korean culture,'' and foreigners have availed themselves of the sexual services provided around United States military bases.

Schulman's book ''The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and Politics'' (June 10), George Packer fails to mention the greatest shift that occurred in the 1970's: the radical transformation of women's status in America. Hardly an amorphous time to 51 percent of the population, that decade brought Title IX and the legalization of abortion, introduced ''domestic violence'' as a term (and created a network of shelters for battered women), and saw women infiltrating all-male colleges and all-male professions -- to name a few things. This reminds me of a recent debate at the United States Postal Service. The people there were trying to figure out if they should include women's liberation as one of their stamps representing the 70's. Ultimately, it made the cut -- right up there with that life-changing social movement known as disco.

Translated by Margaret Sayers Peden. 274 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $17.95.    FEW literary legends can compare to that surrounding ''The House of the Spirits,'' Isabel Allende's family-chronicle-cum-history of her native Chile. Her very first novel, published when she was in her early 40's, rose to best-sellerdom. Reviewers were indulgent. Here was a beautiful, humane, talented woman who happened to be the exiled niece of the martyred Chilean President Salvador Allende. The troublesome secret was that in prose and format the book was mostly imitation Garcia Marquez.   Happily, Ms. Allende is no longer the novice in ''Of Love and Shadows,'' a suspenseful thriller. Set in the terrorized Chile of Gen. Augusto Pinochet (himself an occasional character), it tells of the love that grows between Irene Beltran - feisty, innocent, marginally upper-class and a reporter for a women's magazine - and Francisco Leal, son of impoverished Spanish Republican exiles, an unemployed psychologist and sometime political activist who casually drifts into Irene's office as a freelance photographer. Together they cover a variety of beats, but something clicks when they start investigating Evangelina, a 15-year-old peasant girl and fabled miracle worker. During a brutal army search of her family's house, Evangelina, in a trance, singlehandedly lifts up a cruel lieutenant and hurls him out the door.   Soon thereafter Evangelina ''disappears''; through journalistic tips and footwork the hero and heroine locate the girl's corpse in an abandoned mine shaft, where bodies of dozens of the regime's opponents are also decaying. Francisco takes photos; word spreads; a scandal ensues. Then someone sprays Irene with bullets from a passing car. She survives in the hospital but is obviously marked for Government liquidation. With help from friends she and Francisco assume disguises, quietly flee Santiago and cross the Andes into Argentina, ready to fight the dictatorship from exile. ''We will return,'' they say. LOVE and struggle a la ''Casablanca'' - it's all there. Ms. Allende skillfully evokes both the terrors of daily life under military rule and the subtler forms of resistance in the hidden corners and ''shadows'' of her title, particularly in the churches or in simple unsung acts of solidarity. At the same time the author ably captures the voices of the regime's apologists - the complex lies and cliches of its proud male foot soldiers and the pat false phrases of its rich lady cheerleaders. A journalist herself, Ms. Allende renders with expert detail such offbeat worlds as the professional routines of a hairdresser, the range of types in a private nursing home or the operations of the Santiago city morgue. While her prose at times verges on soap opera, that is also one of its charms. She can just as deftly depict loving tenderness as convey the high fire of eroticism. And when you've successfully mingled sex and politics with a noble cause, how can you go wrong?   While the translation by Margaret Sayers Peden is at times awkward (for example, ''pythoness'' and ''chiromancy'' instead of ''fortune teller'' and ''palmistry'') and could use more colloqualisms and contractions, on the whole it's a supple piece of work."},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"OF LOVE AND SHADOWS (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"ALLENDE, ISABEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOK REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"1987-07-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Book Review Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Gene","middlename":"H.","lastname":"BELL-VILLADA","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By GENE H.

But lives there a mind unsullied by the influence of Mad?<\/p>\n<p>The gap-toothed, mentally challenged grin of the magazine's freckled mascot, Alfred E.

Andy Warhol said it taught him to love people with big ears.<\/p>\n<p>But who is Alfred E. Neuman and why is he still looking at us like that? Isn't he showing his age a bit, now that movies have become parodies of themselves, advertisements have become Madly self-referential entertainments and ''South Park's'' sound effects have replaced ''What -- me worry?''<\/p>\n<p>The answers aren't simple; neither is Alfred. He is a man of many devices. His face actually existed long before Mad existed, goofily appearing on matchbooks, soda advertisements and turn-of-the-century ''dental parlor'' souvenirs. In her history of the magazine, ''Completely Mad,'' Maria Reidelbach suggests that Alfred is an archetypal American trickster, the outsider who becomes the lord of misrule, the inverter of reason and order, thriving in every era.<\/p>\n<p>But now his weakness is unmistakable. In 1972 Mad's circulation reached a peak of over two million. As of April 2009, the magazine has gone quarterly, and 2008 circulation has been estimated at below 200,000. Mad once defined American satire; now it heckles from the margins as all of culture competes for trickster status. What is left to overturn?<\/p>\n<p>Immediately after World War II, though, the magazine's mission was clear: to mock culture's pretense and test its limits. Mad's founder, William M. Gaines, following in the footsteps of his father (who may have invented the American comic book), was coming under increasing attack for his grotesque horror comics. Psychologists, congressmen and newspapers joined in an alliance; The Hartford Courant referred to the ''filthy stream that flows from the gold-plated sewers in New York.'' Gaines responded by stirring the waters further, casting his critics into the roaring current.<\/p>\n<p>Mad burst on the scene in the early 1950s with a series of comic books written by Harvey Kurtzman, considered by many the godfather of underground comics. Cartoonists like Art Spiegelman and Joe Sacco have spoken with reverence of Mr. Kurtzman, whose first comic book, in 1952, was called ''Tales to Drive You MAD: Humor in a Jugular Vein.''<\/p>\n<p>''When you look at the Mad comic book under the direction of Harvey Kurtzman, it blows your mind,'' Mr. Sacco once said. ''It opened cartoonists up to what the possibilities of the medium were. It showed how zany comics could be. It had a profound influence on every great underground cartoonist, from Robert Crumb to S. Clay Wilson.''<\/p>\n<p>And the influence, these cartoonists said, extended into American society. The legions of young boys (the readership has been overwhelmingly male) who would religiously read the magazine were taught how to thumb their noses at authority.<\/p>\n<p>''Mad was more important than pot and LSD in shaping the generation that protested the Vietnam War,'' Mr. Spiegelman, a staff writer and cartoonist for The New Yorker, once said. ''Mad was an urban junk collage that said, 'Pay attention, the media are lying to you -- including this comic book.' ''<\/p>\n<p>The first issues of Mad were themselves a challenge to the pieties of traditional comics, ridiculing their sugary innocence, showing, for example, a seedy Mickey Mouse, badly needing a shave. Reading those early issues, one can follow the editors and writers gradually lifting their gaze and finding similarly hypocritical forces all around them in advertising, movies and business. Even the glories of classic verse turn banal: ''In Levittown did Irving Kahn\/ A lovely Cape Cod house decree.''<\/p>\n<p>So for the Mad writers, Alfred's is the moronic face left when authority is stripped of all pretense. But it is also the unfazed visage of the ''gang of idiots'' creating and reading the magazine, who are treated like clods by the surrounding world, but are really immune to its surreptitious designs. The unknowing child with the unyielding smile helps unmask adult venality: Mad's features often transformed children's forms -- nursery rhymes and reading primers -- into sardonic commentaries on adult life.<\/p>\n<p>In all this Alfred E. Neuman helped enshrine the dominant view we still have of the conformist 1950s. And as Mad's editor once explained, the magazine eventually helped shape the 1960s counterculture. But by the late 1970s these notions of opposition had themselves become mainstream. What pretensions could Mad puncture without repeating itself? Young adolescents hardly needed to be tutored in distrusting authority. American popular culture had become a culture of opposition and satire.

Pomposity was ridiculed (recall the Ministry of Silly Walks) but so was the pretense of pointing out pomposity. All forms of politics dissolve into a kind of comic nihilism.

Only one method, the century-old condom, is both as effective and safe as some of the contraceptives available to women. The outlook for male contraceptives is not much brighter. A report by The Alan Guttmacher Institute, issued just over a week ago, outlined 11 new birth control techniques ''on the horizon''; only two were for men. Even those - gossypol, a cottonseed oil derivative that interferes with sperm production, and synthetic forms of the brain hormone LHRH, which turns off testicular function - have at least eight years of experimentation and testing before they are commercially viable, assuming their serious side effects can be circumvented. The World Health Organization has said it might be more than 20 years before a new male contraceptive is marketable.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WHY A LAG IN MALE-ORIENTED BIRTH CONTROL?"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"BIRTH CONTROL AND FAMILY PLANNING"}],"pub_date":"1983-10-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Health; Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Jane","middlename":"E.","lastname":"Brody","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Jane E.

The Arab world? Forget it. Even in Israel, where tough-minded Golda Meir graced the Prime Minister's office, the \"four princes\" in Likud's successor generation have no place for a princess.    Ah, but what of the land of equal opportunity, where the U.S. Mint can't get rid of its Susan B. Anthony dollars? In closely watched Senate races in California, Illinois and Rhode Island, the women lost all three; one of the losing candidates, Representative Lynn Martin, has been appointed Labor Secretary.    The low percentage of women with real political power in the U.S. is an offense to democratic ticket-balancing. Two Senators out of a hundred; three Governors out of fifty; 6 percent of the seats in the House; and in cities with populations over 30,000, according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics, only one mayor in six is female.    If you're looking for a ray of light, that city showing is up from a pitiful 1 mayoralty in 25 cities 15 years ago, and a similar rise from a low base is reflected in state legislatures. Every Administration in Washington says it has appointed more women than ever before, and presumably political appointments encourage candidacies to elective office.    But progress is much too slow because women of every political stripe -- at home and around the world -- are letting down their own sexual side by not demanding more female candidates and by not supporting them when they run.    Granted, universal suffrage came to politics late; yes, women who are activists often turn off inactivists; sure, sex is not the main qualification for office. But now is now, women are voting -- and not enough are candidates and too few are winning. Why?    The power of incumbency is an excuse, as is the tug of tradition and the demands of rearing children. The reason, however, is a dismaying lack of assertiveness of group identity.    \"Vote as you shot\" rallied veterans; \"he's one of our own\" pulled out ethnic and minority support; \"no quotas\" attracts whites. All other things on issues being roughly equal, women should strongly support women as women until some parity is reached. Then, secure in a system in balance, they can throw the rascals out regardless of sex.   \"I used to look at the papers,\" says an 88-year-old Englishwoman of whom I have long been fond, \"and see Maggie right there, a splash of color in the middle of a bunch"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd1b4bf8eb7c8105d6d9d87","word_count":315,"slideshow_credits":null}]}]
