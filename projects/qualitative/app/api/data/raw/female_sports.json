''Why would a girl want to play football?'' ''Girls will get injured because they're smaller and weaker than boys.''   ''If you let girls play on boys' teams, you'll have to let boys play on girls' teams and the boys will dominate the sport.''   These are the stereotypes embodied in the recently nullified New York State regulation that prohibited all girls in all public high schools in New York from trying out for all contact sports. Like most stereotypes, they are true for some people and not for others.   When the Westchester Chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union asked me to challenge this regulation in court, I was not aware of its existence. An avid football fan, I grew up in a football family, and later watched my son play in countless elementary, junior high and high school games. But the idea of girls playing football with boys had not occurred to me.   Consequently, when Jacqueline Lantz and her parents sought my help in fighting the barrier that prevented her from trying out for junior varsity football at Lincoln High School in Yonkers, I was forced to confront the stereotypes that I, and most other New Yorkers, had never had occasion to consider.   The first question was easy: why would a girl want to play football? The answer came quickly: for the same reasons that a boy wants to play. Football is fun and challenging; it develops teamwork, strength of character, competitive instincts and leadership qualities; it provides camaraderie with teammates and recognition and admiration from classmates; it helps with admission and scholarships to college; and, in some cases, it leads to a lucrative career in professional football.   Not surprisingly, these are rewards that appealed to Jacqueline Lantz, and convinced her that the long months of physical training and risk of injury associated with football were worth enduring. Her parents were supportive of her desire to be the best she could be, while never minimizing the risks of injury faced by all those who engage in contact sports.   A Hollywood casting director could not have sent me a more ideal plaintiff for a lawsuit challenging out-moded ideas about females in our society. Jacqueline is bright, athletic and articulate, with a gentle manner that hides an indomitable spirit. When she was first prevented from trying out for the junior varsity squad, she continued fighting because she ''just wanted to play football.'' But after a year and a half of being told that her only disqualification was being a girl, her desire to play fused with a determination to remove the state rule that predetermined that every girl is physically inferior to every boy.   Yonkers coaches and school officials, many of whom were sympathetic to Jacqueline's desire to play, were bound by the state rule, so it was necessary to sue the State Commissioner of Education and the Board of Regents, who are jointly responsible for enacting and enforcing rules governing the public schools, as well as the Yonkers School Board and the New York State Public High School Athletic Association.   We asked the U.S. District Court to strike down the regulation as unconstitutional because it denied girls equal treatment under the law, as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.   Laws that discriminate on the basis of sex are permitted under the Constitution only if they accomplish a valid governmental objective in a way reasonably calculated to further that interest. This law, we believed, neither furthered an important government interest or treated girls in a fair and reasonable way.   At trial the issues were sharply defined. The Government defendants offered expert testimony to prove a fact we readily conceded: the average girl is smaller, weaker and slower than the average boy. This disparity, they argued, makes the average girl more prone to injury than the average boy, and justifies prohibiting all girls, no matter how big, strong and fast, from qualifying to play football against boys. Safety, they said, is an important governmental objective that permits sex discrimination, and the regulation is reasonable because it prevents all girls from risking injury.   We argued that safety was not the only governmental objective in athletics. If it were, boys would not be permitted to play football, since there is a wide range in size, strength, speed, and consequent risk of injury among boys who play, as well. We pointed out that every court that has considered this issue has ruled that the Government cannot prohibit female competition in mixed football competition, because such participation fosters athletic opportunities for girls and redresses past discrimination against girls in sports. The most reasonable and safe way to accomplish these goals, the courts have said, is by considering girls as individuals, not as averages.   The Supreme Court has gradually struck down broad generalizations about females that do not hold true for all members of the sex. In these days when the Harlem Globetrotters have a woman player and a team of female climbers makes an assault on Mount Everest, it is hard to believe that in the recent past we have had laws to ''protect'' women because they were considered too delicate to practice law, work at night, tend bar, drive trucks, fight fires or engage in many other traditionally male activities.   The government also argued that permitting girls' participation on boys' teams would require reciprocal permission for boys to play on girls' teams. They feared that this could lead to dominance by boys and an actual decrease in girls' participation. This argument has been uniformly rejected by appellate courts around the country because past discrimination against females in sports justifies a prohibition of boys' playing on girls' teams - in order to promote equality of opportunity. The application of this concept of affirmative action to women is now firmly established by the Supreme Court.   In addition, the Government's argument that permitting girls to participate in contact sports with boys would decrease overall participation by girls in athletics was contradicted by the defendants' own witnesses. They testified that in the years since girls had been allowed to compete against boys in other sports such as baseball, tennis and soccer, the number of girls involved in athletics had increased dramatically.   After considering these arguments and facts, Judge Louis Stanton ruled that a safety regulation that prevents all girls, even those who could play safely, from trying out for football, while permitting all boys, even those who could not play safely, was too broad to be reasonably related to its objective. He found that it was unfair to prohibit those girls who were strong and fit enough to play, merely because the average girl was not as fit as the average boy.   Judge Stanton ordered that Jacqueline Lantz be given the same chance as her male teammates to display her abilities, and declared that the regulation that deprived her of her right to try out on an equal basis with boys was unconstitutional. In doing so, he ruled that Jacqueline Lantz, and every other girl in a New York State public high school, must be treated as an individual and not as an average.   Jacqueline's victory was not only a victory for high school girls. An additional benefit is that the publicity surrounding her suit has focused attention on the safety of high school football as presently regulated by the State Education Commission. The commission's experts testified to the inordinate risk of injury that accompanies football played by students of widely disparate weight, height and maturity, and the Government's evidence showed that this disparity is the greatest among boys. If this lawsuit causes the Regents and the commissioner to devise football safety regulations based on classifications by size (such as presently exist in boxing and wrestling) Jacqueline's victory will make football safer for all those who play.   Jacqueline is now on the junior varsity squad at Lincoln High School. Her coach says she's not in condition to engage in contact scrimmage and play, largely because she missed the first seven weeks of practice. But Jacqueline respects his right and duty to make that judgment. She's just happy to be there every day, and proud to be one of the team.

Many readers questioned why so much attention is paid to female athletes and argued that the fact that 57 percent of college students are now female is proof of discrimination against men by colleges and universities. Others asserted that Title IX overlooks the fact that men and women have different interests, and raised the question of whether fewer women want to play sports. Still others said the examples cited in the article showed that, 40 years after it was passed, Title IX needs to be rewritten.","abstract":"An article about Title IX and the roster management policies that universities use to balance their compliance numbers brought passionate responses from readers as well as a number of questions.

I strongly agree that female coaches are important role models for female athletes. The 60 coaches I interviewed often described the influence they have on their athletes' lives.
