''Why would a girl want to play football?'' ''Girls will get injured because they're smaller and weaker than boys.''   ''If you let girls play on boys' teams, you'll have to let boys play on girls' teams and the boys will dominate the sport.''   These are the stereotypes embodied in the recently nullified New York State regulation that prohibited all girls in all public high schools in New York from trying out for all contact sports. Like most stereotypes, they are true for some people and not for others.   When the Westchester Chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union asked me to challenge this regulation in court, I was not aware of its existence. An avid football fan, I grew up in a football family, and later watched my son play in countless elementary, junior high and high school games. But the idea of girls playing football with boys had not occurred to me.   Consequently, when Jacqueline Lantz and her parents sought my help in fighting the barrier that prevented her from trying out for junior varsity football at Lincoln High School in Yonkers, I was forced to confront the stereotypes that I, and most other New Yorkers, had never had occasion to consider.   The first question was easy: why would a girl want to play football? The answer came quickly: for the same reasons that a boy wants to play. Football is fun and challenging; it develops teamwork, strength of character, competitive instincts and leadership qualities; it provides camaraderie with teammates and recognition and admiration from classmates; it helps with admission and scholarships to college; and, in some cases, it leads to a lucrative career in professional football.   Not surprisingly, these are rewards that appealed to Jacqueline Lantz, and convinced her that the long months of physical training and risk of injury associated with football were worth enduring. Her parents were supportive of her desire to be the best she could be, while never minimizing the risks of injury faced by all those who engage in contact sports.   A Hollywood casting director could not have sent me a more ideal plaintiff for a lawsuit challenging out-moded ideas about females in our society. Jacqueline is bright, athletic and articulate, with a gentle manner that hides an indomitable spirit. When she was first prevented from trying out for the junior varsity squad, she continued fighting because she ''just wanted to play football.'' But after a year and a half of being told that her only disqualification was being a girl, her desire to play fused with a determination to remove the state rule that predetermined that every girl is physically inferior to every boy.   Yonkers coaches and school officials, many of whom were sympathetic to Jacqueline's desire to play, were bound by the state rule, so it was necessary to sue the State Commissioner of Education and the Board of Regents, who are jointly responsible for enacting and enforcing rules governing the public schools, as well as the Yonkers School Board and the New York State Public High School Athletic Association.   We asked the U.S. District Court to strike down the regulation as unconstitutional because it denied girls equal treatment under the law, as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.   Laws that discriminate on the basis of sex are permitted under the Constitution only if they accomplish a valid governmental objective in a way reasonably calculated to further that interest. This law, we believed, neither furthered an important government interest or treated girls in a fair and reasonable way.   At trial the issues were sharply defined. The Government defendants offered expert testimony to prove a fact we readily conceded: the average girl is smaller, weaker and slower than the average boy. This disparity, they argued, makes the average girl more prone to injury than the average boy, and justifies prohibiting all girls, no matter how big, strong and fast, from qualifying to play football against boys. Safety, they said, is an important governmental objective that permits sex discrimination, and the regulation is reasonable because it prevents all girls from risking injury.   We argued that safety was not the only governmental objective in athletics. If it were, boys would not be permitted to play football, since there is a wide range in size, strength, speed, and consequent risk of injury among boys who play, as well. We pointed out that every court that has considered this issue has ruled that the Government cannot prohibit female competition in mixed football competition, because such participation fosters athletic opportunities for girls and redresses past discrimination against girls in sports. The most reasonable and safe way to accomplish these goals, the courts have said, is by considering girls as individuals, not as averages.   The Supreme Court has gradually struck down broad generalizations about females that do not hold true for all members of the sex. In these days when the Harlem Globetrotters have a woman player and a team of female climbers makes an assault on Mount Everest, it is hard to believe that in the recent past we have had laws to ''protect'' women because they were considered too delicate to practice law, work at night, tend bar, drive trucks, fight fires or engage in many other traditionally male activities.   The government also argued that permitting girls' participation on boys' teams would require reciprocal permission for boys to play on girls' teams. They feared that this could lead to dominance by boys and an actual decrease in girls' participation. This argument has been uniformly rejected by appellate courts around the country because past discrimination against females in sports justifies a prohibition of boys' playing on girls' teams - in order to promote equality of opportunity. The application of this concept of affirmative action to women is now firmly established by the Supreme Court.   In addition, the Government's argument that permitting girls to participate in contact sports with boys would decrease overall participation by girls in athletics was contradicted by the defendants' own witnesses. They testified that in the years since girls had been allowed to compete against boys in other sports such as baseball, tennis and soccer, the number of girls involved in athletics had increased dramatically.   After considering these arguments and facts, Judge Louis Stanton ruled that a safety regulation that prevents all girls, even those who could play safely, from trying out for football, while permitting all boys, even those who could not play safely, was too broad to be reasonably related to its objective. He found that it was unfair to prohibit those girls who were strong and fit enough to play, merely because the average girl was not as fit as the average boy.   Judge Stanton ordered that Jacqueline Lantz be given the same chance as her male teammates to display her abilities, and declared that the regulation that deprived her of her right to try out on an equal basis with boys was unconstitutional. In doing so, he ruled that Jacqueline Lantz, and every other girl in a New York State public high school, must be treated as an individual and not as an average.   Jacqueline's victory was not only a victory for high school girls. An additional benefit is that the publicity surrounding her suit has focused attention on the safety of high school football as presently regulated by the State Education Commission. The commission's experts testified to the inordinate risk of injury that accompanies football played by students of widely disparate weight, height and maturity, and the Government's evidence showed that this disparity is the greatest among boys. If this lawsuit causes the Regents and the commissioner to devise football safety regulations based on classifications by size (such as presently exist in boxing and wrestling) Jacqueline's victory will make football safer for all those who play.   Jacqueline is now on the junior varsity squad at Lincoln High School.

Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Sandra","middlename":"Gardner","lastname":"SOME","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Sandra Gardner SOME parents who have been accused of molesting their children say they are victims of a new style of child-custody war - one in which vengeful former spouses charge them with sexually abusing their children as a way to eliminate visitation or gain sole custody.   ''That's what you get in South Jersey, when you get a divorce, you get charged with sex abuse,'' said Margaret E. Allen of Burlington City.   Miss Allen is the co-founder of the New Jersey chapter of VOCAL (Victims of Child Abuse Laws) and the fiancee of Christopher Clauss, who was arrested and charged with molesting his then 2 1\/2-year-old daughter on May 4, 1984. (The final divorce decree was granted May 14.) Mr. Clauss was later found not guilty in a Burlington County trial.   Miss Allen said that the charges against Mr. Clauss had stemmed from visitation difficulties with his former wife.   ''And you automatically lose your visitation rights,'' she said, ''and that's the way you lose custody, when you're charged with this.''   Miss Allen said that 90 percent of the 76 members of New Jersey VOCAL were involved in custody or visitation battles, had recently become involved with a new partner, or both. The chapter, formed in February 1985, was patterned after a group in Minnesota (there are reportedly 65 chapters in the country).   The New Jersey group is mostly male, but does include a few women accused of molestation and girlfriends and wives of men in the group. (Nearly all have been charged with abusing their own children, but some have been accused of molesting children they live with.) Miss Allen said that the state Department of Human Services' Division of Youth and Family Services, whose mandate is to protect children, did not follow proper procedure in investigations.   The division's actions, Mr. Clauss said, ''smack of Nazi Germany in 1933 and the McCarthy era.''   Geoffrey S. Perselay, the acting Human Services Commissioner, said of VOCAL: ''I'll quote from Shakespeare: 'Thou dost protest too much.' ''   ''There is a big difference,'' he said, ''between being 'not guilty' and being found 'not guilty' by a court, with the limitations on testimony. For example, the ability of a 2-year-old child, often your best witness, to express itself as to what occurred.''   ''It's frustrating as hell to sit here,'' he said, ''cloaked in confidentiality, being under court order not to disclose particular facts of a case, with no opportunity to defend ourselves. It's difficult enough to prosecute these cases and protect children, and then you have a group like this, trying to detract focus from the children.''   Senator Catherine A. Costa, Democrat of the Seventh District (parts of Burlington and Camden Counties), who has been meeting with members of VOCAL, said: ''It's a very serious situation. A lot of these people are really hurting bad. In some instances it's a means of gaining custody. It's a sad situation - extremely cruel. Full justice has to rise to the surface in cases of innocence.''   Elderly people, women with young children, the handicapped and the poor will have problems getting their food, nutrition, and health needs met when the Middlesex County Board of Social Services moves to the outskirts of New Brunswick from the downtown area, says Enrico De Gironimo, assistant coordinator of Community Outreach Program for Senior Adults, a Rutgers community mental-health agency, and a member of the central New Jersey Rainbow Coalition.   The coalition - comprising social workers, community activists and recipients of social services -has been protesting the move.   ''A lot of these people are walk-ins, or take the bus downtown,'' said Mr. De Gironimo, ''and it's part of the 'hidden agenda' of the New Brunswick gentrification effort to drive the poor out of sight.''   The lease on the social services building is held by Rutgers, which plans to take it over for its Mason Gross School of the Arts in June 1987; Rutgers, in turn, is being forced out of its present site for the school.   The recent decision to place the county's social services in a leased building on Route 27, bordering Franklin Township, was made by the county freeholders and the Board of Social Services. However, financing and decisions for the board are dictated by the freeholders, according to Mary L. Hollis, director of the Board of Social Services.   ''There will probably be some clients who will have some difficulty in getting there,'' Mrs. Hollis admitted. ''We have a considerable number of clients who walk in.''   According to Dorothy K. Power, deputy director of the Middlesex Board of Chosen Freeholders, ''there will be no hardship.''   ''It's a 3 1\/2-mile trip to the edge of town,'' she said, adding, ''We could have gone to Edison or Metuchen.''   Mrs. Power said the county was considering providing a small bus to pick up clients. ''Or they could mail things in, or call,'' she said. As for putting up a building in downtown New Brunswick, Mrs. Powers said, ''It would not be commercially feasible and there would be no parking spaces for the workers and the clients.''   Quentin Smith, a community consultant for the New Brunswick Outreach Center, a private nonprofit social-service agency, and spokesman for the coalition, said that the group was investigating the possibility of a class-action suit and would also use political and ''street'' tactics to deal with the issue.   ''Since they - the city and county policy makers - are making us, the poor and minority groups, uncomfortable - we'll have to make it difficult and uncomfortable for them, in terms of pickets and boycotts,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Additionally, we're planning a political response, when the coalition organizes its October convention, in terms of strategy for the 1986 election campaigns.''   Do you know the ''New Jersey connection'' for Lillian Moller Gilbreth, Carrie Bamberger Frank Fuld, Virginia Apgar, Ruth Cheney Streeter and Fanny Brice?   You can find the answers - and a lot more about many other women (53 in all) - in ''Eastern Her Story, 1986 Engagement Calendar,'' just off the press from Planned Parenthood of Northwest New Jersey, based in Morristown.   The 125-page book is filled with biographies of famous and not-so-famous contemporary and historical women in the Eastern states who have made contributions in the arts, sciences, government and other walks of life.   Decisions on whom to include were based on representation in geography, race, ethnic group, career, past and present figures, as well as proportions of well-known women and ''finds,'' as Jeff Brand, executive director of the Planned Parenthood affiliate, put it.   The calendars, which will be sold at $8.95 to raise funds, ''were a natural, in terms of celebrating contributions made by American women, and, at the same time, producing income for a women's health organization,'' Mr. Brand said.   For those who would like to get to know their ''finds'' a bit more, ample bibliographic material is provided.   ''We need to institutionalize our concern for the young,'' says State Senator Leanna Brown, Republican of Chatham.   Mrs. Brown, whose 26th District takes in parts of Morris and Passaic Counties, proposes to accomplish this by forming a new standing Senate committee on children. She plans to introduce a resolution calling for such a committee in the next legislative meeting.   ''When you have a standing legislative committee, you have hearings and linkages of how various programs can help,'' Mrs. Brown said, explaining that bills affecting children are now assigned to many committees and often get side-tracked in the bureaucratic maze.   For instance, she cited her own bills: One deals with discrimination against families with children in rental housing, the other creates an ombudsman for children. Both measures have not progressed.   A committee on children would be part of a three-pronged approach to children's issues, said Mrs. Brown. The proposed Governor's Commission on Youth and Families (recommended by an executive children's policy committee) would function as a recommender of policies; an ombudsman would follow the proposals through, at the executive level, and the legislative committee would implement legislation on children's issues.   A new standing committee can be created by resolution or by the more complicated change in rules, which would most likely not take place until the beginning of a new session"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd150258eb7c8105d630fa8","word_count":0,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2006\/10\/02\/new-uk-discrimination-law-may-make-for-litigious-bankers\/","snippet":"Middle-aged male bankers in Britain could be among the first to sue their employers using age discrimination legislation that took effect in Britain on Sunday.

''That's what you get in South Jersey, when you get a divorce, you get charged with sex abuse,'' said Margaret E. Allen of Burlington City.   Miss Allen is the co-founder of the New Jersey chapter of VOCAL (Victims of Child Abuse Laws) and the fiancee of Christopher Clauss, who was arrested and charged with molesting his then 2 1\/2-year-old daughter on May 4, 1984. (The final divorce decree was granted May 14.) Mr. Clauss was later found not guilty in a Burlington County trial.   Miss Allen said that the charges against Mr. Clauss had stemmed from visitation difficulties with his former wife.   ''And you automatically lose your visitation rights,'' she said, ''and that's the way you lose custody, when you're charged with this.''   Miss Allen said that 90 percent of the 76 members of New Jersey VOCAL were involved in custody or visitation battles, had recently become involved with a new partner, or both. The chapter, formed in February 1985, was patterned after a group in Minnesota (there are reportedly 65 chapters in the country).   The New Jersey group is mostly male, but does include a few women accused of molestation and girlfriends and wives of men in the group. (Nearly all have been charged with abusing their own children, but some have been accused of molesting children they live with.) Miss Allen said that the state Department of Human Services' Division of Youth and Family Services, whose mandate is to protect children, did not follow proper procedure in investigations.   The division's actions, Mr. Clauss said, ''smack of Nazi Germany in 1933 and the McCarthy era.''   Geoffrey S. Perselay, the acting Human Services Commissioner, said of VOCAL: ''I'll quote from Shakespeare: 'Thou dost protest too much.' ''   ''There is a big difference,'' he said, ''between being 'not guilty' and being found 'not guilty' by a court, with the limitations on testimony. For example, the ability of a 2-year-old child, often your best witness, to express itself as to what occurred.''   ''It's frustrating as hell to sit here,'' he said, ''cloaked in confidentiality, being under court order not to disclose particular facts of a case, with no opportunity to defend ourselves. It's difficult enough to prosecute these cases and protect children, and then you have a group like this, trying to detract focus from the children.''   Senator Catherine A. Costa, Democrat of the Seventh District (parts of Burlington and Camden Counties), who has been meeting with members of VOCAL, said: ''It's a very serious situation. A lot of these people are really hurting bad. In some instances it's a means of gaining custody. It's a sad situation - extremely cruel. Full justice has to rise to the surface in cases of innocence.''   Elderly people, women with young children, the handicapped and the poor will have problems getting their food, nutrition, and health needs met when the Middlesex County Board of Social Services moves to the outskirts of New Brunswick from the downtown area, says Enrico De Gironimo, assistant coordinator of Community Outreach Program for Senior Adults, a Rutgers community mental-health agency, and a member of the central New Jersey Rainbow Coalition.   The coalition - comprising social workers, community activists and recipients of social services -has been protesting the move.   ''A lot of these people are walk-ins, or take the bus downtown,'' said Mr. De Gironimo, ''and it's part of the 'hidden agenda' of the New Brunswick gentrification effort to drive the poor out of sight.''   The lease on the social services building is held by Rutgers, which plans to take it over for its Mason Gross School of the Arts in June 1987; Rutgers, in turn, is being forced out of its present site for the school.   The recent decision to place the county's social services in a leased building on Route 27, bordering Franklin Township, was made by the county freeholders and the Board of Social Services. However, financing and decisions for the board are dictated by the freeholders, according to Mary L. Hollis, director of the Board of Social Services.   ''There will probably be some clients who will have some difficulty in getting there,'' Mrs. Hollis admitted. ''We have a considerable number of clients who walk in.''   According to Dorothy K. Power, deputy director of the Middlesex Board of Chosen Freeholders, ''there will be no hardship.''   ''It's a 3 1\/2-mile trip to the edge of town,'' she said, adding, ''We could have gone to Edison or Metuchen.''   Mrs. Power said the county was considering providing a small bus to pick up clients. ''Or they could mail things in, or call,'' she said. As for putting up a building in downtown New Brunswick, Mrs. Powers said, ''It would not be commercially feasible and there would be no parking spaces for the workers and the clients.''   Quentin Smith, a community consultant for the New Brunswick Outreach Center, a private nonprofit social-service agency, and spokesman for the coalition, said that the group was investigating the possibility of a class-action suit and would also use political and ''street'' tactics to deal with the issue.   ''Since they - the city and county policy makers - are making us, the poor and minority groups, uncomfortable - we'll have to make it difficult and uncomfortable for them, in terms of pickets and boycotts,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Additionally, we're planning a political response, when the coalition organizes its October convention, in terms of strategy for the 1986 election campaigns.''   Do you know the ''New Jersey connection'' for Lillian Moller Gilbreth, Carrie Bamberger Frank Fuld, Virginia Apgar, Ruth Cheney Streeter and Fanny Brice?   You can find the answers - and a lot more about many other women (53 in all) - in ''Eastern Her Story, 1986 Engagement Calendar,'' just off the press from Planned Parenthood of Northwest New Jersey, based in Morristown.   The 125-page book is filled with biographies of famous and not-so-famous contemporary and historical women in the Eastern states who have made contributions in the arts, sciences, government and other walks of life.   Decisions on whom to include were based on representation in geography, race, ethnic group, career, past and present figures, as well as proportions of well-known women and ''finds,'' as Jeff Brand, executive director of the Planned Parenthood affiliate, put it.   The calendars, which will be sold at $8.95 to raise funds, ''were a natural, in terms of celebrating contributions made by American women, and, at the same time, producing income for a women's health organization,'' Mr. Brand said.   For those who would like to get to know their ''finds'' a bit more, ample bibliographic material is provided.   ''We need to institutionalize our concern for the young,'' says State Senator Leanna Brown, Republican of Chatham.   Mrs. Brown, whose 26th District takes in parts of Morris and Passaic Counties, proposes to accomplish this by forming a new standing Senate committee on children. She plans to introduce a resolution calling for such a committee in the next legislative meeting.   ''When you have a standing legislative committee, you have hearings and linkages of how various programs can help,'' Mrs. Brown said, explaining that bills affecting children are now assigned to many committees and often get side-tracked in the bureaucratic maze.   For instance, she cited her own bills: One deals with discrimination against families with children in rental housing, the other creates an ombudsman for children. Both measures have not progressed.   A committee on children would be part of a three-pronged approach to children's issues, said Mrs. Brown. The proposed Governor's Commission on Youth and Families (recommended by an executive children's policy committee) would function as a recommender of policies; an ombudsman would follow the proposals through, at the executive level, and the legislative committee would implement legislation on children's issues.   A new standing committee can be created by resolution or by the more complicated change in rules, which would most likely not take place until the beginning of a new session"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd150258eb7c8105d630fa8","word_count":0,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/07\/06\/nyregion\/municipal-employees-bias-suits-rise-under-bloomberg.html","snippet":"Critics of the Bloomberg administration say the growing caseload and large settlement payouts raise questions about the city\u2019s efforts to tackle discrimination....","lead_paragraph":"Critics of the Bloomberg administration say the growing caseload and large settlement payouts raise questions about the city\u2019s efforts to tackle discrimination.","abstract":null,"print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2011\/07\/05\/nyregion\/20110706-discrimination-gr\/20110706-discrimination-gr-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2011\/07\/05\/nyregion\/20110706-discrimination-gr\/20110706-discrimination-gr-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2011\/07\/06\/nyregion\/DISCRIMINATION1\/DISCRIMINATION1-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2011\/07\/06\/nyregion\/DISCRIMINATION1\/DISCRIMINATION1-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"Municipal Employees\u2019 Bias Suits Rise Under Bloomberg","main":"City Workers\u2019 Bias Suits Rise, Despite Softer Bloomberg Tone","print_headline":"City Workers\u2019 Bias Suits Rise, Despite Softer Bloomberg Tone"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","value":"Government Employees","name":"subject"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","value":"Discrimination","name":"subject"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","value":"New York City","name":"glocations"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","value":"Bloomberg, Michael R","name":"persons"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","value":"Giuliani, Rudolph W","name":"persons"}],"pub_date":"2011-07-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metro","section_name":"N.Y. \/ Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"firstname":"David","middlename":"W.","lastname":"CHEN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"firstname":"Jo","middlename":"Craven","lastname":"McGINTY","rank":2,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By DAVID W.

The three women complained last year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that they were subjected to a hostile work environment while working for Tratoros Construction Inc., a general contractor hired by the New York Housing Authority to renovate the Williamsburg Houses in northern Brooklyn. After investigating their claims, the commission filed a sexual discrimination suit on their behalf in United States District Court in Brooklyn. In its formal complaint, the commission said, ''Offensive and unwelcome comments were made regarding women's menstruation and sexual activity.'' The complaint accuses one of the company's male supervisors of telling his male colleagues to leave the women alone ''because they had cramps'' and ordered the women to ''change their Pampers.'' The supervisor also asked the women if they had recently had sex and publicly accused two of them of having an affair, according to the complaint. The three women say they were forced to clean bathrooms and kitchens and wash windows while the men did demolition and paint jobs. Chris Curis, a spokesman for Tratoros, said the company denied all of the allegations and he could not discuss continuing litigation.
