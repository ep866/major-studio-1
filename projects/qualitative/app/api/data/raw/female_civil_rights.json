The New Jersey Division of Civil Rights ruled this week that the clubs' ties to the university render them public accommodations and therefore subject to the same law concerning discrimination as the university. The decision came in a five-year-old complaint by Sally Frank, a 1980 Princeton graduate whose requests to join the eating clubs were rejected in 1979. The decision, which established state jurisdiction over the clubs, is not binding, but will probably result in an order by the division for the clubs to consider women for admission, according to the participants. Such an order could be appealed to the courts, however.","abstract":null,"print_page":"38","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"COURT FIGHT SEEN ON PRINCETON CLUBS"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"PRINCETON UNIVERSITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CIVIL RIGHTS, NEW JERSEY DIVISION OF"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUITS AND LITIGATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"DISCRIMINATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"}],"pub_date":"1985-05-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1515f8eb7c8105d632f85","word_count":853,"slideshow_credits":null}]}]
