Underlying this concern is the historic competition of religion and sports. Both vie for the same leisure time of their adherents. They share time and space and frequently adjust to each other. Several years ago, the N.F.L. abandoned its plan to begin Sunday games at 12:30 P.M. when members of the Christian clergy feared the mass exodus of male worshipers to attend kickoffs.

The conference was intended to bring together ''a leadership group of women of faith'' - Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Moslems and evangelicals - to talk in a supportive manner about what they have in common, what they do not and what the future may bring. Mrs. Gibel, a program specialist for the American Jewish Committee, was a coordinator of the conference.

My own take is that religion has often been part of the problem, but that it also can be part of the solution. I've seen people kill in the name of religion, and I've seen people reject condoms in the name of religion even as a tool for fighting AIDS (which usually means people dying). But I've also seen Catholic nuns showing unbelievable courage and compassion in corners of the world where no other aid workers are around, and mission clinics and church-financed schools too numerous to mention. And in Islamic countries, I've seen mullahs who are hypocritical misogynists but also some imams who are leading a push for education and justice. In short, I don't think there's any glib answer to the question, but there is no question that religions can be a force for justice and equality that they are now not.
