But June Stephenson, a research psychologist from Napa, Calif, has a doozy.

The study shows that ''the police should use arrests quite frequently in typical domestic violence cases if they want to reduce assaults,'' according to James K. Stewart, director of the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice. The traditional police response to family violence - providing advice and mediation or removing the attacker for eight hours - has been criticized in recent years by women's groups seeking to increase the use of arrest. The institute-sponsored study, conducted in Minneapolis in l98l-82, was the nation's ''first controlled experiment in the use of arrest,'' Mr. Stewart said. It found that an arrest, even if not followed by conviction, was a far more effective deterrent than the traditional police response.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ARREST MAY BE DETERRENT IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, STUDY SHOWS"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"JUSTICE, DEPARTMENT OF"},{"name":"subject","value":"VIOLENCE"},{"name":"subject","value":"ASSAULTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FAMILIES AND FAMILY LIFE"}],"pub_date":"1984-05-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Living Desk","section_name":"Home and Garden","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"organization":"AP","original":"AP","person":[]},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd138578eb7c8105d60b788","word_count":629,"slideshow_credits":null}]},{"key_9":{"message":"API rate limit exceeded"}}]
