You may leak urine from time to time. Or, you may not be able to hold any urine. The three main types of urinary incontinence are: Stress incontinence -- occurs during certain activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise. Urge incontinence -- involves a strong, sudden need to urinate. Then the bladder squeezes and you lose urine. You don't have enough time after you feel the need to urinate to get to the bathroom before you do urinate. Overflow incontinence -- occurs when the bladder cannot empty. This leads to dribbling. Mixed incontinence -- involves more than one type of urinary incontinence. Bowel incontinence is when you are unable to control the passage of stool. It is not covered in this article.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Urinary Incontinence"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"healthtopic","_id":"51fa8b7b38f0d8740ac89163","word_count":"11805","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/11\/10\/opinion\/10brooks.html","snippet":"The images, modes and attitudes of hip-hop and gangsta rap are so powerful they are having a hegemonic effect across the globe....","lead_paragraph":"After 9\/11, everyone knew there was going to be a debate about the future of Islam.

We may have to go to strength here, to the wives of our professional athletes, the women who deal with reality every day while their husbands entertain us with their games and themselves with their ''slump-buster'' groupies.","abstract":"Robert Lipsyte column discusses findings by Steven M Ortiz about professional athletes by interviewing their wives; photo (M)","print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BackTalk; Spoiled Athletes Have Syndrome All Their Own"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ORTIZ, STEVEN M"},{"name":"subject","value":"ATHLETICS AND SPORTS"}],"pub_date":"2001-10-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Robert","rank":1,"lastname":"LIPSYTE"}],"original":"By ROBERT LIPSYTE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd232408eb7c8105d7c20d1","word_count":935,"slideshow_credits":null}]},{"key_3":[{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2013\/07\/28\/us\/ap-us-fruitvale-the-message.html","snippet":"Oscar Grant did not deserve to die....","lead_paragraph":"Oscar Grant did not deserve to die.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"AP Essay: Black Male Humanity Shown in 'Fruitvale'","print_headline":"AP Essay: Black Male Humanity Shown in 'Fruitvale'"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2013-07-28T10:20:10Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"51f52b3738f0d8431a75bfe4","word_count":"942","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/02\/world\/middleeast\/hamas-imposes-new-restrictions-on-schools-in-gaza.html","snippet":"The new law enforces a more rigid separation of sexes in schools and prohibits any relations with Israelis....","lead_paragraph":"The new law enforces a more rigid separation of sexes in schools and prohibits any relations with Israelis.","abstract":"Hamas, Islamic group that rules the Palestinian Gaza Strip, issues new education law enforcing more rigid separation of sexes in schools and prohibiting any relations with Israelis, in line with its strictly religious and nationalist ideology; critics view law as latest move to impose more Islamic lifestyle on people of Gaza.","print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"seo":"Hamas Adds Restrictions on Gaza Schools","main":"Hamas Adds Restrictions on Schools and Israelis","print_headline":"Hamas Adds Restrictions On Schools And Israelis"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","value":"Hamas","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","value":"Palestinians","name":"subject"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"Y","value":"Education (K-12)","name":"subject"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"Y","value":"Gaza Strip","name":"glocations"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"Y","value":"Israel","name":"glocations"},{"rank":"6","is_major":"N","value":"Meshal, Khaled","name":"persons"}],"pub_date":"2013-04-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Middle East","byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Fares","rank":1,"lastname":"AKRAM"}],"original":"By FARES AKRAM"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"515d93f5cf28d0219d000266","word_count":"537","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2004\/12\/05\/theater\/newsandfeatures\/05gate.html","snippet":"Five of the most talked-about shows on Broadway are one-person celebrity productions....","lead_paragraph":"This season, Broadway has turned into something of a comedy club. At the moment, five of the most talked-about shows are one-person celebrity productions (not counting the occasional accompanist or Dame Edna's four leggy dancers), and everybody has a lot to say. ANITA GATES 'Whoopi' Whoopi Goldberg THEMES: Drugs, erectile dysfunction, politics. (''If you upset about gay people getting married, don't marry one.'') IMPERSONATIONS: Some old friends, including Fontaine, a homeless ex-burglar; and the little black girl with ''long, luxurious blond hair.'' And a newcomer, Lurleen, a menopausal ''Sex and the City'' fan. POLITICAL STATEMENTS: ''I said, 'George, you go get Osama,' and then I went to bed. I woke up the next day, and we was in Iraq.'' AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION: Singing along to ''I'll Be Watching You.'' '700 Sundays' Billy Crystal THEMES: A nice Jewish boy's half-comic, halfdramatic recollection of a New York childhood. IMPERSONATIONS: Mostly Mr .Crystal as himself, but he also plays Eleanor Roosevelt, his parents and Aunt Sheila from Boca Raton (''We are the only barren grandparents in our cul de sac''). POLITICAL STATEMENTS: Comparison of President Kennedy's assassination to Sept. 11, plus an odd reference to food served ''on a bed of Condoleezza Rice.'' AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION: None. 'Dame Edna: Back With a Vengeance!' Dame Edna Everage (Barry Humphries) THEMES: One woman's words of wisdom, a little music and helpful lifestyle tips. (''I don't pick on people. I empower them.'') IMPERSONATIONS: Dame Edna mentions family members, bridesmaids, Snoop Dogg and the pope, but her favorite subject is herself (''I'm still Edna from the block''). POLITICAL STATEMENTS: To an audience member who has been to Italy, she says, ''You're already more traveled than the president of the United States.'' AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION: Frequent, and most of it reluctant. 'Laugh Whore' Mario Cantone THEMES: Act I: Making fun of celebrities. Act II: Making fun of his family (''It was like a Scorsese casting call.'') IMPERSONATIONS: A million of 'em: the schoolchildren in ''The Birds,'' Bette Davis doing ''The Vagina Monologues'' and Liza Minnelli singing ''I want to throw up in a city where I can't sleep.'' POLITICAL STATEMENTS: Suspicion about the way Osama bin Laden holds the microphone. AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION: A straight male audience member is serenaded. 'The Good Body' Eve Ensler THEMES: An ode to every woman's hate for some part of her body and a diatribe against the culture that feeds that hatred. IMPERSONATIONS: Helen Gurley Brown, a 35-year-old model who married her cosmetic surgeon and an Indian woman who cherishes her fat. POLITICAL STATEMENTS: An Afghan woman about a visit to a ''secret ice cream-eating place for women'': ''If we get caught, it could mean a flogging or even an execution.'' AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION: Mass sucking-in of abdominal muscles.","abstract":"Chart compares one-person celebrity comedy productions currently on Broadway; photos (M)","print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2004\/12\/01\/theater\/Cantone75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2004\/12\/01\/theater\/Cantone75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"height":55,"subtype":"tiny_thumb","legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":55,"tinythumbheight":55,"hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image","width":55}],"headline":{"main":"Comedy Tonight: Broadway Goes Stand-Up","kicker":"THEATER"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ENSLER, EVE"},{"name":"persons","value":"HUMPHRIES, BARRY"},{"name":"persons","value":"GOLDBERG, WHOOPI"},{"name":"persons","value":"CANTONE, MARIO"},{"name":"persons","value":"CRYSTAL, BILLY"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMEDY AND HUMOR"},{"name":"subject","value":"THEATER"}],"pub_date":"2004-12-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts; Theater","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Anita","lastname":"GATES"}],"original":"By ANITA GATES"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd254e68eb7c8105d7fcf04","word_count":453,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/04\/27\/opinion\/sunday\/the-media-has-a-woman-problem.html","snippet":"A new study shows a stubborn gender disparity....","lead_paragraph":"A new study shows a stubborn gender disparity.","abstract":"Op-Ed article by author Liza Mundy, program director at New America Foundation, highlights report by Women's Media Center showing that male reporters still account for 63 percent of bylines in nation's top 10 papers and about same proportion of newsroom staff; warns that stubborn gender disparity in news media seems to be persisting even as media moves in a digital direction.","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Media Has a Woman Problem","kicker":"Opinion","print_headline":"The Media Has a Woman Problem","content_kicker":"Opinion"},"keywords":[{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","value":"Careers and Professions","name":"subject"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","value":"Women and Girls","name":"subject"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"Y","value":"Women's Media Center","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","value":"News and News Media","name":"subject"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","value":"Newspapers","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2014-04-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"OpEd","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":"Sunday Review","byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Liza","rank":1,"lastname":"MUNDY"}],"original":"By LIZA MUNDY"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"535c0cdb38f0d86f3893b4fd","word_count":"1137","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/atwar.blogs.nytimes.com\/2012\/02\/27\/in-a-baghdad-e-r-womens-psychological-wounds-go-untreated\/","snippet":"Mental health care in Iraq is almost unknown, and seeking it carries a heavy social stigma.

IPOD PEOPLE -- From the University of Wisconsin to Fordham, Hamilton College to Princeton, students don't miss a beat: Their most essential item is their iPod, the pocketsize jukebox that can store up to 10,000 songs. Apple reports that it has sold 3.7 million iPods since it introduced the portable music player in October 2001; last quarter's sales were triple those of a year ago. Schools have taken note: Duke will distribute complimentary iPods to all 1,650 incoming freshmen this fall. ''Everyone has an iPod -- everyone,'' says Jan Tobias Monty, who just graduated from the University of Oregon. ''It's kind of a problem, because there are thousands of accessories, and you want all of them.'' For instance, with a microphone add-on, you can record lectures. Or say something clever to the cute international student down the hall by downloading a language translator from the Talking Panda service. Here's something free: the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy has specially formatted the United States Constitution for iPods.

Yet it was, as Mr. Burke was quick to add, everything that fashion can be. It was theater and politics and sex and provocation, in a way that people have come to expect from Mr. Ford, who was mobbed backstage by a claque of well-wishers. If the event had a faint melancholy flavor it was due to a sense that Mr. Ford may decide to cash in his fashion chips altogether once he leaves Gucci later this year, after his two women's collections, and may head for Hollywood with his companion, the Vogue Hommes editor Richard Buckley, to direct movies, leaving the style scene without its favorite conjurer.","abstract":"Guy Trebay reviews men's wear collection shown in Milan by Tom Ford, his last for Gucci; photo (M)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Review\/Fashion; Selling Not Just a Man, but a Gucci Man"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"FORD, TOM"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MILAN (ITALY)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GUCCI AMERICA INC"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Guy","rank":1,"lastname":"TREBAY"}],"original":"By GUY TREBAY"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd24f158eb7c8105d7f176a","word_count":703,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/07\/22\/business\/media\/usa-swimming-promotes-cannonballs-instead-of-football-.html","snippet":"The organization is trying to increase the number of youngsters who choose to perfect flip turns rather than jump shots, with a public-service advertising and promotional campaign....","lead_paragraph":"The organization is trying to increase the number of youngsters who choose to perfect flip turns rather than jump shots, with a public-service advertising and promotional campaign.","abstract":"Andrew Adam Newman Advertising column; competitive swimming organization USA Swimming is trying to increase the number of youngsters engaging in the sport, at all levels, with a public-service advertising and promotional campaign.","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2014\/07\/22\/business\/Adco\/Adco-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2014\/07\/22\/business\/Adco\/Adco-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2014\/07\/22\/business\/Adco\/Adco-articleLarge.jpg","height":820,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2014\/07\/22\/business\/Adco\/Adco-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"820"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2014\/07\/22\/business\/Adco\/Adco-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2014\/07\/22\/business\/Adco\/Adco-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"USA Swimming Calls for Everyone to Get in the Pool ","kicker":"Advertising","print_headline":"A Call for Everyone to Get in the Pool","content_kicker":"Advertising"},"keywords":[{"rank":"3","is_major":"Y","value":"Swimming","name":"subject"},{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","value":"Advertising and Marketing","name":"subject"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","value":"USA Swimming","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","value":"Youth","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2014-07-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business","section_name":"Business Day","subsection_name":"Media","byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"firstname":"Andrew","middlename":"Adam","lastname":"NEWMAN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"53cdb33538f0d85c8d908425","word_count":"819","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/12\/02\/arts\/television\/02bell.html","snippet":"HBO's comedy special is an occasionally funny, occasionally awful affair filled with innocuous and dated observational humor....","lead_paragraph":"Thirty years ago, Robert Klein received an invitation to perform his increasingly popular brand of stand-up for the fledgling HBO network's first comedy special.

His fame had grown in the early 70's with the release of his first comedy album, ''Child of the 50's,'' which won a Grammy nomination in 1973 and took its place among the essential furnishings of East Coast college dorm rooms -- if not necessarily the ones belonging to the bong-and-fringed-suede set, then those inhabited by professional-class aspirants who wore ribbed turtlenecks and fondly recalled their upstate New York summer camps.

In sold-out performances on four islands, with fiercely powerful chant and dance handed down for as many as 300 years, Halau o Kekuhi brought to the stage the saga of Pele, the goddess of volcanoes, and Hiiaka, her sister.","abstract":"Nalani Kanakaole and Pualani Kanakaole Kanahele, Hawaiian sisters who run hula school in Honolulu, create first hula opera, Holo Mai Pele, and television version will be broadcast on PBS's Great Performances; it is first time that traditional Hawaiian work has been selected for series; photo (M)","print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Dance, Chant, Volcanoes: A Hula Opera Comes to TV","kicker":"ARTS IN AMERICA"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"GREAT PERFORMANCES (TV PROGRAM)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"HOLO MAI PELE (OPERA)"},{"name":"persons","value":"KANAKAOLE, NALANI"},{"name":"persons","value":"KANAHELE, PUALANI KANAKAOLE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"HAWAII"},{"name":"subject","value":"HULA (DANCING)"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"OPERA"},{"name":"subject","value":"DANCING"}],"pub_date":"2001-10-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jocelyn","rank":1,"lastname":"Fujii"}],"original":"By Jocelyn Fujii"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd24c508eb7c8105d7ebe87","word_count":1006,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/06\/22\/fashion\/thursdaystyles\/22leather.html","snippet":"There was a time when people whose erotic rituals ran to whips and chains and latex and highly complex protocols of dominance and submission were confined to the cultural shadows.

Mr. Perlstein overlooks that the sixties' values he misses are still part of the college experience, but these values are expressed differently by a new generation. We're not inferior, just unique.","abstract":"In his fantasy of the 1960s, Mr. Perlstein longs for the good old days of college: a hippie-radical-beatnik's paradise, free of social conventions and responsibility.
