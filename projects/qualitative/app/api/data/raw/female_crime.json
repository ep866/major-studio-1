The scene is a fiction -- a television spot that is part of a new public education campaign from the Family Violence Prevention Fund. But it is also a fact. Millions of Americans have known for a long time what it is to hear the neighbors battling, or see a wife take a punch from her husband. Those that didn't know do now. The story of O. J. and Nicole Simpson has become a national teach-in.","abstract":null,"print_page":"16","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Violence Begins at Home"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"DOMESTIC VIOLENCE"}],"pub_date":"1994-07-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1c0ca8eb7c8105d6ef4fd","word_count":433,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2016\/12\/05\/world\/europe\/05reuters-europe-migrants-germany-crime.html","snippet":"The German government said on Monday nobody should try to make political capital out of a criminal case involving an Afghan refugee suspected of raping and murdering a German university student....","lead_paragraph":"The German government said on Monday nobody should try to make political capital out of a criminal case involving an Afghan refugee suspected of raping and murdering a German university student.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Germany Warns Against Backlash Over Afghan Refugee Suspected of Murder","print_headline":"Germany Warns Against Backlash Over Afghan Refugee Suspected of Murder"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2016-12-05T14:09:28+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Europe","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"5845752195d0e0392607425f","word_count":"390","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1997\/10\/07\/nyregion\/pataki-to-seek-laws-to-curb-violence-in-the-home.html","snippet":"Releasing the results of a year-long state study into domestic violence fatalities, Gov.

They note that the figures in this study, based on 1994 data, are four times higher than estimates of domestic abuse reported in another major survey. Such violence ''appears to be on the rise,'' said Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National Organization for Women. But this interpretation of the new study is misleading. The most important finding is that of all the women who went to an emergency room for any reason -- roughly 47 million in 1994 -- only half of 1 percent, or around 200,000, sought emergency treatment for injuries resulting from domestic violence. This debunks the claim, widely cited by policy makers and women's groups, that up to a third of women who visit emergency rooms do so because they were assaulted by a current or former partner.","abstract":"Sally L Satel Op-Ed article accuses feminists of distorting new study of domestic violence by Bureau of Justice Statistics to reach conclusion that violence against women is even worse than they thought; photo (M)","print_page":"31","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Feminist Number Games"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"DOMESTIC VIOLENCE"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"FEMINIST MOVEMENT"}],"pub_date":"1997-09-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Sally","middlename":"L.","lastname":"Satel","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Sally L.
