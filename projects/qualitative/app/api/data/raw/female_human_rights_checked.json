Chief Justice William Rehnquist is unexpected author of majority ruling rejecting Nevada's claim of constitutional immunity from suit under Family and Medical Leave Act; majority finds federal law narrowly targeted to address persistent, well-documented workplace problem of gender-based discrimination which assumes that caring for family is women's work;
