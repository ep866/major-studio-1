More than 100 plates capture the blue of summer plumage, the gold and pink eyes of the breeding season, the condorlike flight.

The watered grasslands of Kenya's Maasai Mara Game Reserve - in effect, the northern tip of Tanzania's Serengeti National Park - support giraffes, zebras, gazelles, wildebeest, elephants, black rhinos, water buffaloes and leopards. Above all, Mara is home to Africa's largest and finest population of lions.   Two British naturalists, Brian Jackman and Jonathan Scott, spent several years following a single pride with glances at the savanna's other wildlife. But for all its heaving, Mr. Jackman's prose never breaks free of cliche, though it concentrates tough-mindedly    Not to be confused with Jean- Claude Suar es' previous ''Illustrated Cat,'' ''Photographed Cat,'' ''Literary Cat,'' ''Preppy Cat,'' ''Great Cats'' or ''Cat Scrapbook,'' ''The Indispensable Cat'' pays another elegant tribute to what Anatole France called the only animal to have domesticated man.   There's not much natural history here, even if Mr. Suar es reminds us that cats have been part of human society for only half as long as dogs (5,000 versus 10,000 years). This is, however, the place to learn about such topics as cats in movies. Mack Sennett claimed to find the pioneer, a gate-crashing kitten named Pepper, ''as disarming as the lovely Lillian Gish.'' The poetry and prose included hew to traditional lines.   Among the artists, Edward Lear sketches himself as a fat stork stalked by his beloved, stump-tailed Foss; within his narrow range, George Herriman differentiates between lovesick Krazy and adored Mehitabel; and Fernando Botero paints a fat cat. One misses only an example of the schizophrenic English illustrator Louis Wain's electric-haired apparitions.  DOGS    By Rien Poortvliet.  Illustrated. Unpaged.  New York: Harry N. Abrams. $25.     ''Dogs'' proves a pleasant surprise after Rien Poortvliet's whimsical ''Gnomes'' and its sequels. Mr. Poortvliet sentimentalizes observable creatures too, but their postures and gazes are authentic. And even readers who deplore his aspirations to be a soft-focus Norman Rockwell (as in the many breed portraits in oil on textured canvas) should enjoy the fluent cartoons and earthy annotations of his sketchbook pages.   The current Poortvliet dogs - a pointer, a dachshund and two Jack Russell terriers - merit early and individual introductions. But the book's best story involves a runaway boxer, a windmill and a psychic. ''Cross my heart, not one word of it has been made up,'' the author assures us, but it reads like a collaboration between Alfred Hitchcock and Albert Payson Terhune.  DINOSAURS    An Illustrated History.  By Edwin H. Colbert.  224 pp. Maplewood, N.J.: A Dembner Book\/Hammond.  $30.     The dean of American vertebrate paleontologists supplies a plodding text for illustrations that range from the pseudo-Bewickian to the proto-science-fictional. Readers willing to do some of the synthesis themselves should borrow their children's copies of ''The Illustrated Dinosaur Dictionary'' by Helen Roney Sattler (Lothrop, Lee & Shepard, $17.50) and ''A Field Guide to Dinosaurs'' by the Diagram Group (Avon, paper, $8.95), recommended last month in these pages.  WEIRD & WONDERFUL WILDLIFE    By Michael Marten, John May and Rosemary Taylor.  Illustrated. 224 pp.  San Francisco: Chronicle Books. Cloth, $27.50.  Paper, $14.95.     ''Weird & Wonderful Wildlife'' takes a loosely systematic look at some of nature's more striking evolutionary adaptations. While Michael Marten and his colleagues provide no separate text to speak of, their captions are long, specific and apparently accurate. One learns that the tentacles of a jellyfish called the arctic lion's mane can cover an area more than 500 yards square, that the platypus is one of the few poisonous mammals, that the 2-foot-long tongue of the giant anteater is worked by a muscle anchored to its breastbone.   The dramatic full-page color photographs range from the melancholy ruthlessness of the Philippine eagle (known as the monkey-eating eagle until President Ferdinand Marcos decreed a more dignified appellation) to the virtuosic sexual acrobatics of the great slug. Notwithstanding its carny- barker title, this is the season's best illustrated animal book.  THE GRAND DESIGN    Form and Colour in Animals.  By Sally Foy and Oxford Scientific Films.  Foreword by Gerald Durrell.  Illustrated. 238 pp.  Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. $24.95.     Why are some animals cylinders, others disks and still others logarithmic helixes?  ''The Grand Design'' marries textbook prose, not without its ration of curiosities - an eagle's bones account for only 7 percent of its weight, half as much as its feathers; the male silk moth is physically unable to eat - to largish, surprisingly effective blowups from Oxford Scientific Films. The pictures lose surprisingly little in being abstracted from the group's action sequences for public television's ''Life on Earth'' and other series.  WALKER'S MAMMALS OF THE WORLD    Fourth Edition.  By Ronald M. Nowak and John L. Paradiso.  Illustrated. 1,362 pp. In two volumes. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press. $65.     A classic is worthily revised. Ernest P. Walker (1891-1969), long the assistant director of the National Zoological Park in Washington, not only edited the first, 1964 edition of ''Mammals of the World'' but dedicated himself to obtaining clear black- and-white photographs of every new exhibit at the zoo. Now, after a 90 percent revision of the generic descriptions - the write-ups of what a layman might call ''different animals'' - we have a much expanded fourth edition. It is a model of reference-book making, with page numbers running consecutively through the two volumes and an index to the complete work in each one. Only the condensed table of habitats and the mutually contradictory endangerment classifications pose a bar to easy use. . The book's avocational (or obsessional) origins remain agreeably apparent in some of the photographs' pasted-on, typewritten labels.   ''Walker's Mammals of the World'' is comparable only to the more elaborate, expensive and anecdotal Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia (McGraw-Hill, 13 volumes). It provides up-to-date documentation for the professional and comments on the unique and superlative for the amateur. Of what animal can it be said that ''No other species has ever been as destructive to the habitat on which it depends for survival''? It makes a surprise appearance right after Gorilla gorilla in the ''Primates'' section"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1304d8eb7c8105d5fd142","word_count":170,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2017\/03\/02\/sports\/02reuters-soccer-afcchampions-eastern-kawasaki.html","snippet":"Chan Yuen-ting, the first female coach to lead a men's professional soccer club to a top-flight title, hopes her success with Hong Kong's Eastern will inspire other women to follow their dreams....","lead_paragraph":"Chan Yuen-ting, the first female coach to lead a men's professional soccer club to a top-flight title, hopes her success with Hong Kong's Eastern will inspire other women to follow their dreams.","abstract":null,"print_page":0,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Hong Kong Trailblazer Chan Hopes to Inspire Other Women","print_headline":"Hong Kong Trailblazer Chan Hopes to Inspire Other Women"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2017-03-02T06:27:27+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"58b7bb5995d0e024902fd0d8","word_count":748,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/22\/well\/move\/men-is-exercise-putting-a-damper-on-your-sex-life.html","snippet":"Men who exercise strenuously may have a lower libido than those whose workouts are lighter, a new study found....","lead_paragraph":"Men who exercise strenuously may have a lower libido than those whose workouts are lighter, a new study found.","abstract":null,"print_page":4,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":75,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/28\/health\/23physed-men-running4\/23physed-men-running4-thumbStandard.jpg","rank":0,"height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2017\/02\/28\/health\/23physed-men-running4\/23physed-men-running4-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":75},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/28\/health\/23physed-men-running4\/23physed-men-running4-articleLarge-v2.jpg","rank":0,"height":453,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"xlarge":"images\/2017\/02\/28\/health\/23physed-men-running4\/23physed-men-running4-articleLarge-v2.jpg","xlargeheight":453},"type":"image"},{"width":190,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/28\/health\/23physed-men-running4\/23physed-men-running4-thumbWide-v2.jpg","rank":0,"height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2017\/02\/28\/health\/23physed-men-running4\/23physed-men-running4-thumbWide-v2.jpg","widewidth":190,"wideheight":126},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Men, Is Exercise Putting a Damper on Your Sex Life?","kicker":"Phys Ed","print_headline":"Men\u2019s Workouts Tied to Low Libido","content_kicker":"Phys Ed"},"keywords":[{"isMajor":"N","rank":1,"name":"subject","value":"Testosterone"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":2,"name":"subject","value":"Exercise"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":3,"name":"subject","value":"Athletics and Sports"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":4,"name":"subject","value":"Hormones"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":5,"name":"subject","value":"Sex"}],"pub_date":"2017-02-22T11:00:02+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Science","section_name":"Well","subsection_name":"Move","byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Gretchen","lastname":"REYNOLDS"}],"original":"By GRETCHEN REYNOLDS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"58ad6f3695d0e02474637e92","word_count":882,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2017\/01\/29\/technology\/ap-us-tec-tech-diversity-slow-crawl.html","snippet":"The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers.
